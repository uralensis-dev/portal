COMMENT: 

The features are those of a non-scarring alopecia with follicular loss (low density)  and an increased vellus to terminal hair ratio (as described in androgenetic alopecia), however there is also an increase in telogen/ catagen count (23 %) a finding which anecdotally we have seen in cases of permanent alopecia after chemotherapy.  As far as I know, they are not viable follicle; stuck in that resting stage.  No peribulblar inflammation is present to indicate alopecia areata.
