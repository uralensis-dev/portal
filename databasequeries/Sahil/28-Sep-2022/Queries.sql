The practice information sheet provides patients with information on how to provide feedback, including how to make a complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Patients have a &lsquo;right to complain&rsquo;, and where possible, patients and others are encouraged to raise any concerns directly with the laboratory team, who are all trained to make sure patients of the business feel confident that any feedback or complaints will be handled appropriately. FNQH Pathology are committed to ensuring complaints will be responded to when the patients or other people such as carers, relatives, friends, or other consumers make them known to our team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Under national and QLD privacy laws, FNQH Pathology provides and adheres to a complaints process for privacy issues and those related to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All members of laboratory team are educated to be prepared to address complaints as they arise. Depending on the nature of the complaint and any advice received from our medical indemnity insurers where required, complaints are recorded and actioned with a copy placed in the patient&rsquo;s health record if related to patient care.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All clinical and medical staff and administration staff are aware of the professional and legal obligations regarding the mandatory reporting of unprofessional conduct.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Procedure</p>\r\n<p>Patients and others have opportunities to register their complaints either verbally, in writing (letter), or via our suggestion box. Patients or others are able to complain anonymously if desired. All members of FNQH Pathology are aware of our commitment to address complaints as they arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When receiving complaints, our practice keeps in mind the following in order to minimise further patient anxiety and hostility:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Handle all complaints seriously, no matter how trivial they may seem.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Verbal complaints made in person should be addressed in a private area of the business where possible.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Use tactful language when responding to complaints.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Do not blame others; patients may not have all the facts, or they may distort them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Address the patient&rsquo;s expectations regarding how they want the matter resolved.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Assure the patient that their complaint will be investigated and the matter not disregarded.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Offer the person an opportunity to complete a formal complaint form (they may accept or decline).</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Document all complaints and other relevant information and place this in the complaint folder so the person designated to manage complaints is informed of the complaint (even if the matter appears to have been resolved).</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Alert the Pathologist or lab manage about disgruntled or hostile patients so they can diffuse the situation immediately - often patients are reluctant to make a complaint directly to a general practitioner.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Always inform the person designated to manage complaints if you become aware of any significant statements made by the patient or significant change in patient attitude.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>FNQH Pathology has appointed Glenn Makowksi and Sarah Sharpe Business Operation with designated responsibility for seeking, collecting, analysing, investigating, resolving and managing all feedback and complaints.

We in turn have the same requirements of all parties supplying goods and services to this laboratory.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The following is in place to ensure the requirements of our clients are met:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>We have implemented a quality management system based on ISO 15189 and are committed to its use as a minimum requirement in providing products and services to our customers.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>We aim for continuous quality improvement in all our areas of activity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>The concept of continual quality improvement is embraced by all staff. We encourage staff members to contribute to our quality management through regular meetings and feedback. Staff at all levels are encouraged to initiate, participate in and review quality projects and are provided with the appropriate tools and training.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>We seek feedback from our customers as a means of improving the quality of our service.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>We participate in external and internal Quality Assurance Programs to continually monitor our performance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Quality Objectives</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>To monitor Turnaround Times for a limited set of specific procedures twice yearly and assessed based on National Clinical Indicators</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>To document all laboratory errors via the Quality System, in order to identify systematic approaches to reducing or eliminating errors</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ethics and Behaviour</p>\r\n<p>Consent</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All procedures carried out on patients must be with their informed consent. For routine procedures written consent may not be required; the patient presenting for the collection procedure infers consent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Collection of Information</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Personal information is routinely collected from patients. This information includes that required to properly identify the individual and at times, medical history information or other details necessary to provide the service required. Unnecessary information should not be collected. The patient has a right to know the information collected, and the purpose for which it has been collected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Confidentiality</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All information concerning patients is confidential and must not be disclosed to anyone other than those directly responsible for the patient&rsquo;s care. Staff have a responsibility to ensure that access to records, both written and electronic, is secure. Computer terminals should be logged off when left unattended and password security observed. Any breach of confidentiality, either by commission or omission, will be regarded as serious.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The regulations concerning confidentiality within FNQH Pathology extend to any information gained as a result of employment. Communication with the media concerning the activities of FNQH Pathology is expressly forbidden without the permission of the Managing Director. Any doubts about the provision of information should be referred in the first instance to the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manager.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Performance of Tests</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Testing shall only be performed in an authorised manner, using approved methods and by personnel trained and authorised to perform the testing. Fabrication of results or use of unapproved methods is not acceptable.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Freedom of Information</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Freedom of Information Act guarantees access by members of the public to any information held by the Agency which they are entitled to see. The Agency is required to respond within 30 days of the request.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If a FOI request is made of this department, it should be forwarded the same day to the Lead Pathologist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Operational Integrity</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>No staff member is permitted to present for work in a condition which may impair their ability to effectively and safely carry out their duties (e.g., sickness, excessive tiredness, intoxication). All staff who present for work must be capable of carrying out their duties in a safe and professional manner. If they doubt their ability to carry out their assigned duties, they must advise the Senior Scientist or Laboratory Manager immediately.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If a staff member forms the opinion that another staff member is impaired in their ability to carry out their work the Senior Scientist or Laboratory Manager is to be immediately notified. The Laboratory Management will treat any such information confidentially.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Conflict of Interest</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Section 79 of the State Services Act details an employee&rsquo;s responsibility to disclose and seek permission to operate a business outside of the State Service. In addition, staff will not accept gifts beyond the agreed organisational limit or other disbursements from suppliers or customers that may cause improper attempts to influence staff.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Undue Pressure</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(Examples: being pressured to release results on an assay when QC is out of limits, and before corrective action is initiated, being pressured to act outside your scope of competency).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If at any time staff feel that they are being pressured in any way that would interfere with the quality of the test results, or with the quality of the process, the Lead Pathologist is to be immediately informed of the circumstances. It is essential that a log is recorded accurately detailing the nature of the pressure and any action taken to address the issue. A nonconformance is to be raised. The Lead Pathologist will use their professional judgement and will give the appropriate advice and will take any required action. The staff member involved may be offered counselling if required. If the Lead Pathologist is unable to resolve the situation, then the Managing Director will be advised.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ethical Treatment of Samples and Tissues</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Samples and tissues are to be treated with respect. Inappropriate or unnecessary comments about the appearance or condition of samples are not tolerated. Samples are to be handled and disposed of in an approved manner.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Use of Samples for Other Purposes</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An excess of sample may be used for purposes other than that for which it was collected (e.g., to validate a new test procedure) but only if all identification is removed from the specimen.</p>\r\n<p>Identifiable samples may not be used for purposes other than that for which they were collected.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Standards of Behaviour - Dress and Appearance</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Staff are required to dress in a neat, safe and tidy manner when on duty. No specific dress code is enforced but they should meet general community standards when dressing for work. Waterproof (e.g. leather, rubber) enclosed footwear (closed toe and heel) must be worn, (i.e., no sandals or thongs).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Jewellery should be kept to a minimum to present a professional approach and must not present an Occupational Health and Safety or infection control risk. Consider personal safety when deciding size and style of earrings, necklaces, bracelets (e.g., diameter of sleeper/hoop style).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Long hair should be tied back or covered, and beards covered when undertaking aseptic or sterile procedures. Hair accessories must be functional.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Standards of Behaviour - Courtesy</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Staff are expected to behave in a courteous manner to other staff, patients and visitors at all times, even under provocation. Discourtesy is regarded as a serious breach of discipline. Matters of</p>\r\n<p>dispute that cannot be resolved must be referred to the Laboratory Manager or to a senior staff member.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Standards of Behaviour - Office &amp; Reception Area</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Office and Specimen Reception Area are often the first contact with the Laboratory, either in person or by telephone. The staff in these areas must act in a responsible and professional manner at all times. Rudeness, abruptness and general unhelpfulness is not to be displayed at any time. In areas where staff are visible to customers or can be heard, personal matters are not to be discussed. In addition, matters concerning patients are to be carried out in such a fashion as not to breach confidentiality at any time. Discretion is needed when discussing test requirements and receiving specimens.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Electronic Communication</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Email and Internet activity is governed by specific FNQH Pathology electronic communications policy.</p>\r\n<p>Courier</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The use of FNQH Pathology&rsquo;s car is restricted to staff engaged upon departmental business. Logbooks must be filled out completely after use.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Staff undertaking courier work for the Laboratory are to maintain appropriate standards of presentation that follow acceptable community norms for persons in this position. They are to facilitate specimen collection and report delivery in such a manner that the needs of the customers are met. They are to obey all relevant State Statutes and Regulations concerning being in control of a motor vehicle. Any fines or other penalties are the total responsibility of the person in charge of the motor vehicle. Logbooks must be clearly and accurately filled out for each journey. Refer to the courier manual for further details.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>General Information</p>\r\n<p>Scope of Activities</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The function of FNQH Pathology is to provide a comprehensive Anatomic Pathology service for General Practitioners and Skin Cancer Clinics in the area. FNQH Pathology provides an appropriate service to the laboratory&rsquo;s client base in terms of range of tests, timeliness, cost effectiveness and access.</p>\r\n<p>The policies and procedures within FNQH Pathology are in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Federal and State Acts and NATA guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Normal operation hours are 0800 hours to 1800 hours five days a week. Outside the above hours, an emergency call-back service operates. Pathologists and Senior Staff and are available for consultation when required.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pathologists and Senior Scientific Staff provide professional advice and assistance to referrers. Associated with this are regular clinico-pathology correlation meetings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Department cars are used to run a specimen collection service to FNQH Skin Cancer Clinics. A courier service is used for General Practitioners using the service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reports are delivered by automatic electronic upload to referrers through secure integration with Best Practice or other practice software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Research and Clinical Trials</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We are involved in providing services for clinical trials and research projects. The research / clinical trial must have appropriate agency ethics approval before any activity is agreed to by the Managing Director. We may elect to provide this service for activities within the scope of our accreditation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tertiary service role</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In situations where there is a problem with another laboratory&rsquo;s instrumentation, we are happy to add an occasional sample to our regular batch. Where the procedure is time consuming, resource intensive or exposes the laboratory to additional clinical risk, the Lead Pathologist must be consulted before agreeing to do these tests or procedures. See also section on request forms and contracts later in this manual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Laboratory&nbsp; Policies</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory is covered by policies and operational arrangements as decided by the FNQH Pathology&nbsp; executive &ndash; refer to FNQH Pathology organisational chart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Service to the Client</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The clients of the Laboratory are GPs and Skin Cancer Specialists. These customers are the very reason we exist and as such demand the highest standards, both professionally and personally from all the staff associated with the laboratory.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Client feedback is welcomed and provides a useful guide to areas in which our service could be improved.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Clients are welcome to access and comment on our testing protocols at any time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Location</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory is located at 274 Mulgrave Rd, Westcourt QLD 4870 and consists of the following functional areas:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Specimen Reception</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Pathologist and Laboratory Manager Office</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Laboratory</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Storage Areas</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory is a modern, air-conditioned, well-lit facility for pathology testing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Members of the public must access the laboratory via the reception desk and must not enter the any part of the laboratory unless accompanied by a member of staff.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Access to FNQH Pathology is via Westcourt Shopping Centre and FNQH Skin Cancer Clinic.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Security</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory and offices are secured by locked doors, the public areas are outside the locked zone. Laboratory staff have access to all areas of the laboratory and offices during normal business hours.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any unauthorised visitor found in the laboratory should be challenged. The Laboratory Manager should be notified of suspicious behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After core hours, the Laboratory is locked and access is limited to staff with key access.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cleaning and Waste Disposal</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>FNQH Pathology is serviced by a contracted cleaning service. However, staff are responsible for ensuring that work areas are kept clean and tidy throughout the day and that any spillage or excess rubbish is cleared to maintain a safe working environment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All areas are to be kept free of rubbish or excess items. In particular emergency exits, corridors and walk areas within FNQH Pathology must be kept clear at all times.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Non-infective waste is discarded in the DFO shopping centre compactor, then is taken to the City tip. Infected material and histology specimens will be removed by a biohazardous waste removal service and incinerated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Information Technology</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory information system is PathHub. We have a trained staff member on site for general maintenance and other systems tasks. The application is supported by a service contract with the company and they are responsible for providing comprehensive support and maintenance. FNQH Pathology IT services augment this support as required. Access to the computer system is password protected, and staff have access rights based on need and experience. A system of regular (daily) backup of data is in place and is performed by FNQH Pathology IT services. The laboratory also utilises PathHub as Quality Management Software. The Quality Manager is responsible for overseeing general maintenance, configuration and other system tasks and the application is supported by the parent company Ideagen.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Appropriate records of test results are kept either on hard disc or as hard copy as per NPAAC and NATA Laboratory accreditation recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Validation of Software Changes</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All changes to laboratory information systems or software must be validated prior to introduction. The validation should take account of any potential risk to the integrity of data, and especially of any risk or potential harm to the patient. The rigour of the investigation will depend somewhat on the assessment of risk; this risk assessment is to be documented and is to be carried out by a senior member of staff. The validation is to be clearly documented.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Communications</p>\r\n<p>Clinico-Pathology Meetings</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These are held on a regular schedule. These meetings are to discuss relevant cases and to provide a forum for direct feedback on the performance of the laboratory to the Lead Pathologist other medical and senior staff attend as required.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Senior Staff Meeting</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The senior staff comprising the senior staff responsible for each section, Laboratory Manager, Office Manager, Quality Manager, Pathologists and other persons as necessary meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of relevance to FNQH Pathology. Minutes are kept of these meetings.</p>\r\n<p>Some matters (e.g., personnel matters) may be excluded from these minutes as the Director or Laboratory Manager sees fit. A quorum is four persons including the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manager. Decisions from this meeting are not binding on the Managing Director.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sectional Staff Meetings</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Each section holds regular meetings as required to disseminate information. These meetings occur at least quarterly, but generally more often than this. At this meeting, the Senior Staff will give an outline of any matters discussed at the Senior staff meetings and give staff at all levels the chance to raise matters either to be taken to the next meeting or the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manger for response. These meetings are also the focus for continuing education and review of quality activities. Short minutes are to be kept of these meetings to allow shift workers, persons on leave and those unable to attend to gain an outline of the contents.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>General Staff Meetings</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These are held as required, usually at about 6 monthly intervals, but more often if specific issues arise. Given the nature of shift work it is acknowledged that some staff will be unable to attend meetings. Presentations, continuing education and general discussion are some of the matters that may be raised.</p>\r\n<p>Memoranda</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Memoranda are issued from time to time where a written directive is required. These are distributed throughout the Laboratory or to individuals as necessary. Authority to issue Memoranda lies with the Lead Pathologist or the Laboratory Manager.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>General Communications</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory is committed to providing timely and open communication between all staff. In general, the lines of communication as reflected in the organisation chart should be maintained. This does not preclude direct approach to the Lead Pathologist or the Laboratory Manager if an individual or group so wish. However, many problems will be directed back to FNQH Pathology level for resolution in the first instance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Administration</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Lead Pathologist is responsible for the Laboratory. The Laboratory Manager and Senior staff are individually responsible for a number of management functions that cross over internal departmental boundaries.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Education, accreditation, safety, computerisation and special projects are managed on a day-to- day basis by staff assigned to that area. They in turn, rely on other staff to assist and advise them. A regular meeting of senior staff reviews and discusses management matters.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All Staff are subject to State Acts governing their employment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lines of responsibility</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Staff must determine to whom they are responsible during the shift that they are working. In particular, the responsibility for verification of results must be clearly understood. The sub- departmental head or assigned deputy is responsible for the allocation of duties.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When working outside normal hours, on-call and shift staff are responsible for the range of work authorised to be done.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Assignment of Staff</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Staff are assigned to internal departments according to their skills and training needs, and the needs of FNQH Pathology. Senior staff are usually assigned permanently to one section. Other scientific and technical staff may be expected to acquire and maintain skills that allow them to move between sections and perform the routine &ldquo;on-call&rdquo; procedures. Clerical and support staff may also move between sections as necessary.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Technical management is the responsibility of the Senior Scientist. Technical management of Clerical Services is the direct responsibility of the Laboratory Manager. In the absence of the Supervising Scientist another nominated scientist will deputise in this role</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Quality Officer has the responsibility for ensuring that all aspects of the Quality System are implemented and updated whenever necessary. In the absence of the Quality Officer the Laboratory Manager will fill this role.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Whenever the term &ldquo;Manager&rdquo; is used it should be defined as referring to the incumbent or his or her nominee in the absence of the incumbent.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All staff in the laboratory have a Statement of Duties which is available online and which is updated periodically to reflect any changes in their duties.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Education, accreditation, safety, computerisation, and special projects are managed on a day-to- day basis by senior staff assigned to that area.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Authorisation to Issue Reports or Advice</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Professional Staff may give advice on test choice, frequency, and interpretation within the limits of the individuals&rsquo; knowledge and experience, if in any doubt the query must be referred to a more senior scientist or pathologist. Provisional results should only be released by a pathologist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Visitors, University Students on Practicum, Work Experience Students</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These must be authorised by the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manager. When so authorised, generally they will be placed under the direction and responsibility of an appropriate Senior Scientist. They must be advised of our safety procedures and issues relating to confidentiality and appropriate behaviour. They must be under close, constant supervision. Vigilance must be given to any computer access. Identification must be worn at all times. An appropriate dress code must be maintained. Any problems must be reported immediately to the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory manager.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Deputising Arrangements - Periods of Leave&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lead Pathologist</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of the Lead Pathologist, the Laboratory Manager assumes overall responsibility for the Laboratory. For day-to-day clinical decision-making, the Staff Pathologists are employed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Laboratory Manager</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of the Laboratory Manager, one of the Senior Staff will be selected by the Lead Pathologist to act as Laboratory Manager. This person also assumes the role of Fire Warden.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Senior Staff</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of Senior Staff, a nominated Scientist with sufficient experience and training will be given responsibility for the day-to-day operations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Quality Officer</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of the Quality Officer the Laboratory Manager or his / her delegate will fill this role.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Education, Training, Performance Review</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory has a system of competency assessment to ensure that all staff develop and maintain appropriate skills in all aspects of their work. In addition, staff are expected to attend educational meetings and seminars to maintain and update knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Training and Competency Assessment</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory maintains records to ensure the competence of all staff.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>New staff are given supervision while they work through a documented training program to ensure their level of skill is appropriate for the duties required of them. After this initial training, competency is continually evaluated by senior staff, and additional training provided as required. An annual competency evaluation is completed, this provides a formal opportunity to discuss any issues and offer any further training required.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>NOTE: Training and competency is the responsibility of each individual staff member. It is a staff member&rsquo;s professional duty to ensure that they are demonstrably trained and competent for all tasks performed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Performance Review</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>New staff are given the opportunity to review their progress with their immediate superior at the end of three months, and at the end of six months when the probationary period ends. This is in addition to the continual process of direction and guidance offered.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The annual competency assessment evaluation provides the opportunity for senior staff to review progress and development with the staff member. This is an opportunity to set goals for the next year, identify educational and training needs, establish an understanding of what is expected of the staff member and to provide an opportunity for the discussion of work-related problems. Any such training needs are to be documented on the annual competency assessment record.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Continuing education and professional development</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All scientific and technical staff are expected to maintain a program of self-education.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A regular program of education is established in the laboratory and all staff are to ensure that they attend and document their attendance. Compliance in relation to continuing education and professional development will be discussed at the annual competency assessment. All staff should also keep a personal record of any continuing education attendance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Periodic departmental meetings are held to assist in this process and time off to attend courses directly related to work is available where appropriate. In house training courses are available from time to time and staff are encouraged to attend these courses. A log of an individual\'s continuing education is to be maintained in the personnel file. It is the responsibility of each staff member to ensure that self-education is recorded.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some funds are available to assist staff to attend conferences and meetings and allocation is at the discretion of the Director and Laboratory Manager. The overriding consideration with regard to the selection of staff to attend conferences and seminars are the needs of FNQH Pathology.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Safety</p>\r\n<p>The safety of staff, patients and the public are of paramount importance to the Laboratory. Staff must be aware of policies and procedures, and these must be followed at all times. Reporting of accidents, incidents and near misses is seen as an important quality assurance exercise to reduce the incidence and possibility of injury.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Fire Safety Training, including evacuation drills are undertaken annually as part of the Laboratory Fire Safety Program and training in Manual Handling is undertaken Laboratory wide with all staff participation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Staff are encouraged to attend additional courses where appropriate, for example First Aid or Warden training.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Incidents</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The primary means of notification for all health and safety incidents is via the Standard Operating Procedure and lodged with the Laboratory Manager as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Samples and Requests</p>\r\n<p>General</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Samples are received from GPs and skin cancer clinics at Specimen Reception. Couriers are used to run a specimen collection service to off-site clinics. Taxis are used to augment this service if required. Internally Laboratory Staff are used for the delivery of samples from on-site FNQH Clinics.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Request Forms</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A completed request form signed by the requesting Medical Officer must accompany each request. The sample must be clearly labelled and matched unequivocally with the request form. For Laboratory policy on unsigned requests and inadequately labelled samples, refer to the Laboratory Manual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Under specific circumstances forms signed by a person other than a Medical Officer (e.g. approved health care workers) may be acceptable. The Lead Pathologist, to whom any doubtful cases should be referred, will determine these circumstances. The Health Insurance Commission has determined that a treating medical practitioner may request a pathology service either orally or in writing but oral requests must be confirmed in writing within 14 days from the day when the oral request was made. A facsimile request is taken to have the same status as an original request form.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For further information please refer to the Laboratory Manual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Request as a Contract</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The receipt of a properly completed request form constitutes a contract between the requesting doctor and the laboratory. The laboratory is at all times obligated to do the utmost to provide the requested service, utilising approved methods and within a reasonable time frame. At times a request may be received which cannot be fulfilled due to reasons, for example, of incorrect sample or unavailability of the test. In these circumstances the requesting doctor is to be notified of the inability to fulfil the contract by phone and/or by written report.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Where a pattern of non-fulfilment of contract occurs, senior staff are to be involved in review of these. This is to enable discussion with the requesting doctors and resolution of any problems.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Transport of Specimens</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Couriers are used to run a specimen collection service to off-site clinics. Taxis are used to augment this service if required. Internally Laboratory Staff are used for the delivery of samples from on-site FNQH Clinics.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Transport of Referred Tests</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The method of transport for referred tests will depend on the sample, the availability of suitable carriers and wishes of the Laboratory to whom the work is referred.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All specimens that are transported by carriers are to be packed in accordance with IATA regulations and by persons specifically trained to do so.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Specimen Receipt, Storage and Disposal</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Each sample is given a unique identifying number on receipt in the laboratory and all relevant information about the sample is recorded in the PathHub computer system (refer to the Laboratory Manual).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All samples are stored in the laboratory in appropriate environmental conditions, which are regularly monitored and recorded.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Specimens are stored for an appropriate time, using the current NPAAC guidelines as a minimum requirement. Samples are then disposed of in an appropriate manner as described in the Laboratory Manual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reporting of Results</p>\r\n<p>Reports are sent to the requesting doctor and if required, copy doctor(s). Any other doctor requesting a copy of that report can obtain a copy. The onus is on that doctor to have a legitimate requirement for that result, if in doubt refer to the Lead Pathologist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Urgent Results</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These tests will be given priority and results phoned, faxed or printed to the location specified on the request form. Care must be taken to protect patient confidentiality when phoning urgent results. The procedure for phoning results, as detailed below, should be followed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Critical Results</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any test result considered urgently required for the immediate management of the patient is to be communicated by phone to the unit concerned or to the requesting doctor. These critical results include but are not limited to malignant melanoma and lymphoma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Phoning Results</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is essential that all results issued from the laboratory are correct. Incorrect results or misinterpretation may significantly risk our patient&rsquo;s welfare and compromise staff who issue those results.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In this light any request for results to be provided over the phone MUST, in the first instance, be queried stating our preference to provide a formal copy, either hard copy or electronic. Remind callers that all patient results originating from a request in Best Practice should be available on that platform. In cases where the requestor persists that call must be directed to the appropriate place.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All incoming calls must be assessed and directed according to the type of request.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Before asking any other questions clearly identify the caller and the relationship around the request. If you are unsure or dubious about the need for the caller to have the requested information immediately refer them to your supervisor.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When you are satisfied the call is bona fide proceed as below:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Personal calls &ndash; locate the individual and transfer.

Should a patient become insistent they are referred to the Lead Pathologist or Managing Director (see also &ldquo;freedom of information&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Withdrawal of Results/Result Revision</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In cases where a report has been authorised, but it becomes evident that the results are incorrect, the report must be revised immediately. The ISO15189 Standard requires revised reports to be clearly identified as a revision report and the revision report must include the date and time of the revision, the name of the person responsible for the revision and the original report entries must remain in the record after revisions are made, including the exact change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Immediately upon discovery of the error the revised results are to be phoned or communicated to the appropriate clinical area(s) to ensure they are made aware of any changes to the revised reports. Record the communication.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To issue a revised report when a report has been already authorised and results have been released use the procedure in the Reporting Errors Procedure document.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reporting Results</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reports are sent to the requesting doctor and to any other person or location as directed by the requesting doctor. Any other doctor requesting a copy of that report can obtain a copy. The onus is on that doctor to have a legitimate requirement for that result.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All confidential paper reports are to be addressed to the requesting doctor in a sealed envelope marked &lsquo;confidential&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Before any report is issued, the pathologist must check the results for accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reports are checked for the following:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Patient demographics</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Accuracy and completeness of results</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Tests performed are as requested</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Request form is signed (or re-sent for signing or awaiting signature)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Report comments are appropriate</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Copy doctors are included</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Compliance with laboratory policy</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Results from other laboratories are annotated accordingly</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Turn Around Times</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Average TATs for most assays are provided for referrers. Where there is likely to be a significant deviation from these times (e.g. by reason of instrument maintenance or breakdown) notification should be provided to the key requesting doctors in those areas where rapid turnaround is normally required. If the delay is likely to be extensive and clinically relevant, the Lead Pathologist shall authorise the use of backup services.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Subcontracting of tests and calibrations</p>\r\n<p>For tests that cannot be done at this Laboratory under our Terms of Registration or tests that are low in volume or specialised, a referral Laboratory is selected based on Quality (NATA accredited), previous reliable and timely service, and cost.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The referral laboratory is acknowledged on all reports issued from this laboratory.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A register of all referral laboratories used by us is kept in the referrals database.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Overdue tests for our referral laboratories are monitored in PathHub.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Referred Tests</p>\r\n<p>For all specimens that are referred to another Laboratory, records are maintained to allow verification of shipping and return of results. There is also an audit trail to verify that tests have been returned in a clinically relevant time frame. Where tests are not returned in a relevant time frame, then action is taken with the referral laboratory to review the arrangement, correct the problem or find another suitable laboratory.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Details of specimen requirements for referred tests are kept in the relevant section of the online handbook. All staff packing samples for air transport must have current appropriate IATA certification.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Document Control</p>\r\n<p>All documents, including this Quality Manual, technical procedures, policies, wall charts and forms are reviewed at least every 2 years by the appropriate manager and updated whenever necessary.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All master documents are stored on PathHub and are reviewed by FNQH Pathology heads (or their delegate) with final approval by the Pathologist who oversees that section.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Complaints, Non-conformances and Improvements</p>\r\n<p>Any member of staff who becomes aware of a situation which may require corrective action should notify their Technical Manager as soon as possible. Complaints from clients and suggestions for improvement must also be communicated as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Complaints</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All complaints are documented and directed to the Director of Pathology or Laboratory Manager as soon as they are received. A CA/PA should be raised in PathHub. Follow up can then be recorded.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If a Staff member becomes aware that their action or that of others may result in a complaint being made, they should advise the Director of Pathology or Laboratory Manager as soon as possible with all relevant details.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Control of Nonconforming testing</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory maintains procedures for dealing with problems arising from any aspect of our testing which for any reason does not conform to the test procedures. All such nonconformances are documented by means of a CA/PA in PathHub, as is the action taken to correct it. The Senior Scientist responsible for the area has the responsibility for evaluating the problem and taking appropriate measures to fix the problem</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When any problems are shown to be of a recurrent of systematic nature, more formal corrective action involving the Quality Manager and Laboratory Manager may be necessary.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Corrective Actions</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Corrective actions are necessary to correct nonconforming work practices or any departures from policy or procedure that have been identified.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The procedure for a corrective action begins with investigation to determine the root cause of the problem, followed by implementation of appropriate corrective action and subsequent close monitoring to ensure that the corrective action has been effective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Preventative Action and Improvements</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Preventative action is a proactive process used to identify improvement opportunities, rather than a reaction to the identification of problems or complaints. Follow up procedures are similar to those used for complaints and nonconformances.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Control of Records</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory has established procedures for control of technical and quality records as per the NPAAC guidelines. Records kept include:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>testing and QC reports</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>equipment calibrations</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>internal audits</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>management reviews</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>complaints, corrective, preventative actions</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All records of testing are kept in the PathHub computer system and are accessible to all members of staff with appropriate levels of computer access. All of these records contain full details of tests and results, operator identity and observations or notes and are fully auditable.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Internal Audits</p>\r\n<p>Internal audits are performed on a regular basis. The audit system is organised and maintained by the Quality Manager.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of audits is to monitor the performance of the Quality System and technical procedures, and to determine whether any nonconformance exists or whether improvements can be made and discussed during management meetings (maintain a strong focus on continuous improvement).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Management Review</p>\r\n<p>A Management Review meeting will occur yearly to review policy and operational issues. The Lead Pathologist, Laboratory Manager and Quality Manager attend; other senior staff may occasionally be required to provide specific items.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Items examined include Complaints, Corrective Actions, Improvement Opportunities; Internal and External Audits; Document Control; Client feedback (e.g. customer surveys); Suppliers and Referral Labs; Reports from Senior Staff (Incorporating internal and external Quality Control, TATs, changes to volume/type of work).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Methods &amp; Method Validation</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Procedure manuals are kept for all tests performed in the laboratory. These manuals are part of the document control system and are regularly updated by the Quality Manager and the appropriate Section Manager. Whenever possible the laboratory uses only well documented, standardised methods for testing. Any necessary variations are validated by the appropriate Section Manager prior to use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory documents the performance and comparability of a new test method before it is used routinely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In-house in vitro devices</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In-house in vitro devices (IVD&rsquo;s) are considered therapeutic goods which are regulated under The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. IVD&rsquo;s are expected to be safe, have a high quality and meet expected standards. All manufacturers of IVD&rsquo;s must certify that their products are safe, perform well for the intended purpose and are manufactured to a high standard of quality.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Equipment</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All equipment used for testing is permanently on site in the laboratory and is regularly maintained according to a predetermined schedule and procedure by laboratory staff, or by the manufacturer or their agent. All equipment is operated by trained staff following documented procedures. Each item is uniquely identified and logged in the Assets Module in PathHub to enable records of its history to be kept.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Equipment maintenance records are kept in PathHub. These include calibration and operational checks. Pathology staff perform preventative maintenance on certain items of equipment. Several items of equipment are under Service Contract agreements. Calibration and maintenance procedures and schedules are kept for all relevant equipment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Where a piece of equipment is found to be inoperable it is tagged and removed from service until repairs are carried out. A nonconformance should be raised in PathHub against the Asset.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Specimen Carry-Over</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For all equipment, consideration is to be given as to the potential to report incorrect results due to specimen carry-over. Where this is possible, means shall be put in place to prevent this occurring.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Temporary equipment failure</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>QML Pathology is a NATA accredited Laboratory and, in the event of equipment failure or for any other reason, will provide backup for this Laboratory. In the same manner, we will perform testing for other laboratories as requested.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The need for such a service would not normally exist for more than a day or two at a time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Operator Traceability</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To ensure traceability of the person undertaking the tests, all actions are recorded in PathHub, and any work sheets are annotated with the initials of the person performing the test.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Assuring the Quality of Test Results</p>\r\n<p>Internal and external quality assurance is a vital component in ensuring that the test results and methodologies are of a standard that will not compromise patient care. All quality control results are to be monitored by senior staff and directions for action to be taken are contained in the specific method manuals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory participates in the RCPA and other external Quality Control Programs to provide a comparison of our results with other pathology providers throughout the country.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Use of expired Materials</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All reagents, calibrators and quality control material used must be used within the expiry date of the product. However, it is acknowledged that in exceptional circumstances (for example for reasons of supply or quality of a replacement product) that this may be unavoidable. The use of expired material must only occur after consultation with the Supervising Scientist and under their direction. The test results are only acceptable providing there are no significant shifts or trends in the quality control results. If the quality control results are not acceptable the assay must be suspended until suitable product is available and has been validated. The use of expired material must be reported to the Senior Scientist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>External Quality Assurance Programs</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All external Quality Control Program results shall be submitted by the due date. External Quality Control Results shall be an agenda item at FNQH Pathology meetings. Actions taken to address unsatisfactory performance shall be discussed and noted in the minutes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All external Quality Control results are to be notified to the Lead Pathologist. Remedial actions taken on results with unsatisfactory performance shall be documented on the External Quality Assurance program cycle summary and shall be reviewed by the Lead Pathologist. Where necessary after consultation with the Senior Scientist in charge of the sub-section, the Lead Pathologist shall direct changes to be made in methodologies, procedures or instrumentation or if necessary direct the tests to be done at another laboratory until the problem can be resolved.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory is enrolled in the following External Quality assurance Programs.</p>\r\n<p>PROGRAM<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>EXAMINATIONS/TESTS</p>\r\n<p>RCPA Anatomical Pathology<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Dermatopathology, Technical</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Financial</p>\r\n<p>General Revenue</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Laboratory purchases are made through FNQH Pathology. The Laboratory Manager has authority to purchase all reagents and materials necessary for the day to day operation of the lab. Small items of equipment, (under $5,000) can be purchased in this way although it is wise to clear items such as furniture, refrigerators, and non-scientific equipment with the Managing Director. Computer equipment should be cleared through the CTO.</p>\r\n<p>Disposal of Equipment</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Do not dispose of any equipment without specific authorisation from the Managing Director via the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manager.</p>\r\n<p>Stores</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Storage of consumables, specimen containers etc. is limited to a small storage area in FNQH Pathology.

DISCIPLINE &amp; TERMINATION POLICY</p>\r\n<p>This policy contains guidance on performance and conduct management, and the discipline and&nbsp;termination consequences that may follow. It is strictly for general guidance purposes only and aims to&nbsp;provide employees and management with an understanding of the procedures that may be followed in&nbsp;certain circumstances.&nbsp;In so far as this policy imposes any obligations on the Company, those obligations are not contractual and&nbsp;do not give rise to any contractual rights. To the extent that this policy describes benefits and&nbsp;entitlements for employees, they are discretionary in nature and are also not intended to be contractual.</p>\r\n<p>The terms and conditions of employment that are intended to be contractual are set out in an&nbsp;employee&rsquo;s written employment contract.&nbsp;The Company may unilaterally introduce, vary, remove or replace this policy at any time.</p>\r\n<p>1.1.1. WHAT CONSTITUTES POOR PERFORMANCE?</p>\r\n<p>An employee&rsquo;s performance will be considered poor or unsatisfactory if the employee is repeatedly not&nbsp;meeting the requirements of their role (as set out in the employee&rsquo;s position description, contract of&nbsp;employment, key performance indicators, Company policies, or as communicated to the employee&nbsp;otherwise). Poor performance may be observed by the employee&rsquo;s manager or other relevant person and&nbsp;may or may not be the result of a formal performance evaluation.</p>\r\n<p>1.1.2. WHAT CONSTITUTES MISCONDUCT?</p>\r\n<p>Misconduct includes, but is not limited to:</p>\r\n<p>Unauthorised absenteeism;</p>\r\n<p>Unacceptable behaviour towards managers/supervisors/employees/clients/customers of the&nbsp;Company;</p>\r\n<p>Inappropriate or dishonest behaviour in the workplace;</p>\r\n<p>Any instances of harassment and/or bullying;</p>\r\n<p>Non-compliance with Company policies, procedures or practices;</p>\r\n<p>Failure to follow lawful and reasonable direction from the Company or an authorised representative of the Company.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the nature of the poor performance or misconduct, a number of disciplinary steps may be&nbsp;taken. The action taken will depend on the nature and severity of the employee&rsquo;s conduct. The steps&nbsp;below are listed in order of seriousness of the poor performance and/or misconduct, however, they do&nbsp;not need to be followed in sequential order and how any matter is dealt with is always at the complete&nbsp;discretion of the Company.</p>\r\n<p>1.1.3. INFORMAL COUNSELLING</p>\r\n<p>The Company may informally counsel an employee in order to assist the employee to better understand&nbsp;workplace practices, the required level of conduct and/or performance or any other matter the Company&nbsp;feels it appropriate to raise with the employee for their development. If the employee continues to&nbsp;engage in the conduct and/or poor performance which has been subject of informal counselling, the&nbsp;employee may be subject to any of the disciplinary procedures set out below up to and including&nbsp;termination of employment.</p>\r\n<p>1.1.4. FORMAL DISCIPLINARY PROCESS</p>\r\n<p>If the employee&rsquo;s performance or conduct does not improve following informal counselling, the Company&nbsp;may decide to commence a formal disciplinary process. This process may also be followed without prior&nbsp;informal counselling, where the seriousness of the performance or conduct issues mean it is appropriate&nbsp;to move straight to this stage.&nbsp;The employee will usually be given written notification to attend a meeting in relation to the employee&rsquo;s&nbsp;performance or conduct. Generally, the employee will be given at least 24 notice of the meeting. The&nbsp;letter will set out the performance or conduct issues to be discussed and warn the employee of the&nbsp;potential outcomes of the disciplinary process.</p>\r\n<p>The Company will offer the employee an opportunity to have a support person present during the&nbsp;meeting. The support person is not entitled to play an active role in the meeting and is not entitled to&nbsp;speak on behalf of the employee, but may provide support, guidance and advice to the employee (in&nbsp;private if they so wish).</p>\r\n<p>Generally, the following process will be followed in the disciplinary meeting:</p>\r\n<p>The Company will explain to the employee why the employee\'s performance is not meeting the&nbsp;expected standards (by reference to the employee&rsquo;s job description, contract of employment, key&nbsp;performance indicators, etc) or elaborate on any allegations of misconduct;</p>\r\n<p>The employee will be provided with an opportunity to respond to all such issues;</p>\r\n<p>The Company will explain the potential outcomes of the meeting and the employee will be given&nbsp;an opportunity to respond to this (for example, if termination is being considered, the employee&nbsp;should be given an opportunity to say while they feel this is inappropriate).</p>\r\n<p>Possible outcomes of the meeting include (but are not limited to): no action being taken, the need for further investigation, a verbal warning, a performance improvement plan, a written warning, termination of employment (with notice / payment in lieu of notice) and termination of&nbsp;employment without notice (only in cases of serious misconduct). These are discussed further&nbsp;below.</p>\r\n<p>1.1.5. NO ACTION TAKEN</p>\r\n<p>In certain circumstances the Company will decide that no action will be taken against the employee&nbsp;(because, for example, the allegations of misconduct are found to be unsubstantiated). In this situation&nbsp;the Company will generally confirm the outcome of the disciplinary meeting (and that no action is to be&nbsp;taken) in writing.</p>\r\n<p>1.1.6. FURTHER INVESTIGATION</p>\r\n<p>In some circumstances the Company will need to undertake further investigation following the&nbsp;disciplinary meeting in order to decide on the appropriate action to take. This may occur when, for&nbsp;example, there are conflicting versions of events and the Company is not in a position to make a finding&nbsp;on the issues/allegations.</p>\r\n<p>1.1.7. VERBAL WARNINGS</p>\r\n<p>A verbal warning will generally be appropriate where the employee&rsquo;s performance or conduct has not&nbsp;improved following informal counselling, or in relation to an incident that is not serious enough to&nbsp;warrant a written warning. A verbal warning will involve warning the employee that if their performance&nbsp;or conduct does not improve, they may be subject to more serious disciplinary action.&nbsp;A written record of the verbal warning should be kept.</p>\r\n<p>1.1.8. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN (PIP)</p>\r\n<p>A performance improvement plan (or &ldquo;PIP&rdquo;) is generally used where issues have been identified in an&nbsp;employee&rsquo;s performance that need to be improved. A PIP will set clear goals or targets that the employee&nbsp;is expected to meet by certain dates. The Company will review the employee&rsquo;s performance during the&nbsp;period of the PIP and assist the employee in trying to improve their performance. If the employee&rsquo;s&nbsp;performance does not improve the employee may be required to attend a disciplinary meeting and may&nbsp;be issued a written warning. If the employee&rsquo;s performance does not improve after being issued one or&nbsp;more warnings, they may be required to attend a disciplinary meeting and (if no reasonable excuse can&nbsp;be given for the failure to improve) their employment may be terminated.</p>\r\n<p>1.1.9. WRITTEN WARNINGS</p>\r\n<p>In the event that the Company has serious concerns about an employee&rsquo;s performance or conduct, a written warning may be issued to the employee. This may (but will not necessarily) occur following&nbsp;continued or repeated behaviour raised in earlier informal counselling or in a verbal warning. There may&nbsp;be instances where a written warning may be issued in the first instance, based on the seriousness of the&nbsp;poor performance or conduct.</p>\r\n<p>A written warning will generally inform the employee:</p>\r\n<p>Of the employees\' performance or conduct issues that have been found to be an issue;</p>\r\n<p>Why the Company did not find the employee&rsquo;s response to such issues in the disciplinary meeting&nbsp;to be acceptable;</p>\r\n<p>Of a reasonable timeframe within which the employee must remedy their poor performance&nbsp;and/or conduct;</p>\r\n<p>That if the employee continues to under-perform or engage in misconduct, other disciplinary&nbsp;action may be taken, up to and including termination of employment.</p>\r\n<p>1.2. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT (WITH NOTICE OR&nbsp;PAYMENT IN LIEU OF NOTICE)</p>\r\n<p>Poor performance or misconduct may lead to the termination of an employee&rsquo;s employment (either with&nbsp;notice or payment in lieu of notice).</p>\r\n<p>The number of warnings provided to an employee prior to termination of their employment may vary depending on the circumstances. For example, it may in some circumstances be appropriate for the&nbsp;Company to provide the employee with a number of warnings in relation to the same poor performance&nbsp;or conduct where such poor performance or conduct is of a relatively minor nature, before terminating&nbsp;the employee&rsquo;s employment. Similarly, the Company may provide an employee with a number of&nbsp;warnings where an employee engages in misconduct or poor performance which is separate to that&nbsp;which was the subject of an earlier warning, or which was not reasonably proximate in time to an earlier&nbsp;warning.</p>\r\n<p>In extreme cases of poor performance or misconduct it may be appropriate to terminate employment&nbsp;without any previous warnings having been given.&nbsp;At the disciplinary meeting, the employee will be given an opportunity to explain why they consider&nbsp;termination of employment is not appropriate prior to the Company taking a final decision.</p>\r\n<p>1.3. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT NOTICE&nbsp;(&ldquo;SUMMARY DISMISSAL&rdquo;) IN CASES OF SERIOUS&nbsp;MISCONDUCT&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Serious misconduct is wilful and/or deliberate behaviour by an employee that is inconsistent with the&nbsp;continuation of employment, including but not limited to:</p>\r\n<p>A material breach of the employee\'s employment contract;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Serious failure in the performance of duties or improper or inappropriate use of the employee&rsquo;s&nbsp;position;</p>\r\n<p>Wilful violation of any law or rule of a regulatory body;</p>\r\n<p>Deliberately diverting customers or business away from the Company;</p>\r\n<p>Accepting bribes or secret commissions;</p>\r\n<p>Any conduct that in the reasonable opinion of the Company constitutes a serious or potentially&nbsp;serious conflict of interest, including working for a competitor during the term of the employee&rsquo;s&nbsp;employment;</p>\r\n<p>Refusal to comply with a lawful and reasonable direction given by management or any other&nbsp;person duly allowed by the Company;</p>\r\n<p>Dishonest behaviour and/or acting in a way that is inconsistent with the best interests of the&nbsp;Company;</p>\r\n<p>Deliberately providing false or misleading information to the Company or any of the Company\'s&nbsp;customers or suppliers;</p>\r\n<p>Being convicted of a criminal offence which, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, may have&nbsp;the effect of bringing the Company into serious disrepute or affecting the ability of the employee&nbsp;to meet obligations under the employee&rsquo;s employment contract;</p>\r\n<p>Theft or misappropriation of Company property;</p>\r\n<p>Being under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs whilst at work or on Company property;</p>\r\n<p>Acting in a way which in the reasonable opinion of the Company may injure or be likely to injure&nbsp;the business or reputation of the Company;</p>\r\n<p>Acts of bullying, harassment or discrimination;</p>\r\n<p>Threatening, violent, or offensive behaviour;</p>\r\n<p>Conduct that causes imminent, and serious risk to the health, or safety, of a person or the reputation,&nbsp;viability or profitability of the Company.</p>\r\n<p>At the disciplinary meeting, the employee will be given an opportunity to explain why they consider&nbsp;termination of employment without notice is not appropriate prior to the Company making a final&nbsp;decision.</p>\r\n<p>1.4. RECORD KEEPING</p>\r\n<p>Records of verbal warnings and any written warnings will be placed in an employee&rsquo;s personnel file.</p>\r\n<p>1.5. OTHER POLICIES</p>\r\n<p>Employees are encouraged to read this policy in conjunction with other relevant Company policies,</p>\r\n<p>including:</p>\r\n<p>Workplace Anti-Bullying and Anti-Harassment Policy;</p>\r\n<p>Equal Employment Opportunity and Anti-Discrimination Policy;</p>\r\n<p>Code of Conduct;</p>\r\n<p>Grievance Handling Policy.</p>\r\n<p>2.

To the extent that this policy describes benefits and&nbsp;entitlements for employees, they are discretionary in nature and are also not intended to be contractual.&nbsp;The terms and conditions of employment that are intended to be contractual are set out in an&nbsp;employee&rsquo;s written employment contract.</p>\r\n<p>The Company may unilaterally introduce, vary, remove or replace this policy at any time.</p>\r\n<p>1.2. STAFF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>\r\n<p>All staff are entitled to:</p>\r\n<p>1. Recruitment and selection decisions based on merit and not affected by irrelevant personal&nbsp;characteristics;</p>\r\n<p>2. Work free from discrimination, bullying and sexual harassment;</p>\r\n<p>3. The right to raise issues or to make an enquiry or complaint in a reasonable and respectful&nbsp;manner without being victimised;</p>\r\n<p>4. Reasonable flexibility in working arrangements, especially where needed to accommodate their&nbsp;family responsibilities, disability, religious beliefs or culture.</p>\r\n<p>All staff must:</p>\r\n<p>1. Follow the standards of behaviour outlined in this policy;</p>\r\n<p>2. Offer support to people who experience discrimination, bullying or sexual harassment, including&nbsp;providing information about how to make a complaint;</p>\r\n<p>3. Avoid gossip and respect the confidentiality of complaint resolution procedures;</p>\r\n<p>4. Treat everyone with dignity, courtesy and respect.</p>\r\n<p>1.2.1. ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS</p>\r\n<p>Managers and supervisors must also:</p>\r\n<p>1. Model appropriate standards of behaviour;</p>\r\n<p>2. Take steps to educate and make staff aware of their obligations under this policy and the law;</p>\r\n<p>3.

Act fairly to resolve issues and enforce workplace behavioural standards, making sure relevant&nbsp;parties are heard;</p>\r\n<p>5. Help staff resolve complaints informally;</p>\r\n<p>6. Refer formal complaints about breaches of this policy to the appropriate complaint handling&nbsp;officer for investigation;</p>\r\n<p>7. Ensure staff who raise an issue or make a complaint are not victimised;</p>\r\n<p>8. Ensure that recruitment decisions are based on merit and that no discriminatory requests for&nbsp;information are made;</p>\r\n<p>9. Seriously consider requests for flexible work arrangements.</p>\r\n<p>1.3. UNACCEPTABLE WORKPLACE CONDUCT</p>\r\n<p>Discrimination, bullying and sexual harassment are unacceptable at the Company and are unlawful under&nbsp;legislation including:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth);</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth);</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth);</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Age Discrimination Act 2004 (Cth);</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth).</p>\r\n<p>Staff (including managers) found to have engaged in such conduct might be counselled, warned or&nbsp;disciplined. Severe or repeated breaches can lead to formal discipline up to and including termination of&nbsp;employment.</p>\r\n<p>Under the law staff can be held personally liable for certain breaches of discrimination law, and the&nbsp;Company can also be vicariously liable for staff members&rsquo; conduct.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1.4. DISCRIMINATION</p>\r\n<p>Discrimination is treating, or proposing to treat, someone unfavourably because of a personal&nbsp;characteristic protected by the law, such as sex, age, race or disability.</p>\r\n<p>Discrimination can occur:</p>\r\n<p>Directly, when a person or group is treated less favourably than another person or group in a similar&nbsp;situation because of a personal characteristic protected by law (see list below).&nbsp;For example, a worker is harassed and humiliated because of their race</p>\r\n<p>or</p>\r\n<p>A worker is refused promotion because they are &lsquo;too old&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Indirectly, when an unreasonable requirement, condition or practice is imposed that has, or is likely to&nbsp;have, the effect of disadvantaging people with a personal characteristic protected by law (see list below).&nbsp;For example, redundancy is decided based on people who have had a worker&rsquo;s compensation claim&nbsp;rather than on merit.</p>\r\n<p>Protected personal characteristics under Federal discrimination law include:</p>\r\n<p>1. A disability, disease or injury, including work-related injury;</p>\r\n<p>2. Parental status or status as a carer, for example, because they are responsible for caring for&nbsp;children or other family members;</p>\r\n<p>3. Race, colour, descent, national origin, or ethnic background;</p>\r\n<p>4. Age, whether young or old, or because of age in general;</p>\r\n<p>5. Sex;</p>\r\n<p>6. Industrial activity, including being a member of an industrial organisation like a trade union or&nbsp;taking part in industrial activity, or deciding not to join a union;</p>\r\n<p>7. Religion;</p>\r\n<p>8. Pregnancy and breastfeeding;</p>\r\n<p>9. Sexual orientation, intersex status or gender identity, including gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual,&nbsp;transgender, queer and heterosexual;</p>\r\n<p>10. Marital status, whether married, divorced, unmarried or in a de facto relationship or same sex&nbsp;relationship;</p>\r\n<p>11. Political opinion;</p>\r\n<p>12. Social origin;</p>\r\n<p>13. Medical record;</p>\r\n<p>14. An association with someone who has, or is assumed to have, one of these characteristics, such&nbsp;as being the parent of a child with a disability.</p>\r\n<p>15. It is also against the law to treat someone unfavourably because you assume they have a&nbsp;personal characteristic or may have it at some time in the future.</p>\r\n<p>1.5. DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION</p>\r\n<p>Employers are also required in some circumstances to make &ldquo;reasonable adjustments&rdquo; to facilitate&nbsp;employees with disabilities to perform the &ldquo;inherent requirements&rdquo; of the particular role they perform.&nbsp;An employer will be deemed to have discriminated against an employee if they fail to make these&nbsp;adjustments.</p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;inherent requirements&rdquo; of a position are the essential activities that must be carried out to fulfil the&nbsp;purpose of the position.</p>\r\n<p>An adjustment is not reasonable if it will impose &ldquo;unjustifiable hardship&rdquo; on the employer. In assessing&nbsp;unjustifiable hardship factors to be considered include:</p>\r\n<p>1. The nature of the benefit or detriment to be imposed on any person concerned, including the&nbsp;community;</p>\r\n<p>2. The effect of the employee\'s disability;</p>\r\n<p>3. The financial circumstances and the estimated amount of expenditure required to be made by&nbsp;the employer;</p>\r\n<p>4. The availability of financial and other assistance to the employer.</p>\r\n<p>Examples of adjustments that may in some circumstances be reasonable for an employer to make&nbsp;include:</p>\r\n<p>1. Changing recruitment and selection procedures. For example, providing a sign language&nbsp;interpreter for a Deaf person or ensuring the medical assessor is familiar with a person&rsquo;s&nbsp;particular disability and how it relates to the job requirements.</p>\r\n<p>2. Modifying work premises. For example, making ramps, modifying toilets or providing flashing&nbsp;lights to alert people with a hearing loss.</p>\r\n<p>3. Changes to job design, work schedules or other work practices. For example, swapping some&nbsp;duties among staff or providing regular meal breaks for a person with diabetes.</p>\r\n<p>4. Modifying equipment. For example, lowering a workbench or providing an enlarged computer&nbsp;screen.</p>\r\n<p>5. Providing training or other assistance. For example, running induction programs for staff with a&nbsp;disability and their co-workers, providing a mentor or support person for a person with an&nbsp;intellectual disability, and including staff with a disability in all mainstream training.</p>\r\n<p>6. It is not unlawful to discriminate against a person because of their disability where:</p>\r\n<p>7. They cannot meet the inherent requirements of the job, even when the employer has made any&nbsp;reasonable adjustments; or&nbsp;Providing the person with reasonable adjustments to facilitate their disability imposes an&nbsp;unjustifiable hardship on the employer.</p>\r\n<p>1.6. BULLYING</p>\r\n<p>If someone is being bullied because of a personal characteristic protected by equal opportunity law, it is a&nbsp;form of discrimination.&nbsp;Bullying can take many forms, including jokes, teasing, nicknames, emails, pictures, text messages, social&nbsp;isolation or ignoring people, or unfair work practices.</p>\r\n<p>Under Federal law, this behaviour does not have to be repeated to be discrimination &ndash; it may be a one-off&nbsp;event.</p>\r\n<p>1. Behaviours that may constitute bullying include;</p>\r\n<p>2. Sarcasm and other forms of demeaning language;</p>\r\n<p>3. Threats, abuse or shouting;</p>\r\n<p>4. Coercion;</p>\r\n<p>5. Isolation;</p>\r\n<p>6. Inappropriate blaming;</p>\r\n<p>7. Ganging up;</p>\r\n<p>8. Constant unconstructive criticism;</p>\r\n<p>9. Deliberately withholding information or equipment that a person needs to do their job or access&nbsp;their entitlements;</p>\r\n<p>10. Unreasonable refusal of requests for leave, training or other workplace benefits.</p>\r\n<p>Any form of bullying is unacceptable in the Company and may also be against workplace health and safety&nbsp;law. The Company has a separate Workplace Anti-Bullying and Anti-Harassment Policy which employees&nbsp;must read and abide by, this deals with bullying and harassment that is not a form of discrimination (ie&nbsp;where not based on a protected personal characteristic).</p>\r\n<p>1.7. SEXUAL HARASSMENT</p>\r\n<p>Sexual harassment is a specific and serious form of harassment. It is unwelcome sexual behaviour, which&nbsp;could be expected to make a person feel offended, humiliated or intimidated. Sexual harassment can be&nbsp;physical, spoken or written. It can include:</p>\r\n<p>1. Comments about a person&rsquo;s private life or the way they look;</p>\r\n<p>2. Sexually suggestive behaviour, such as leering or staring;</p>\r\n<p>3. Brushing up against someone, touching, fondling or hugging;</p>\r\n<p>4. Sexually suggestive comments or jokes;</p>\r\n<p>5. Displaying offensive screen savers, photos, calendars or objects;</p>\r\n<p>6. Repeated unwanted requests to go out;</p>\r\n<p>7. Requests for sex;</p>\r\n<p>8. Sexually explicit posts on social networking sites;</p>\r\n<p>9. Insults or taunts of a sexual nature;</p>\r\n<p>10. Intrusive questions or statements about a person&rsquo;s private life;</p>\r\n<p>11. Sending sexually explicit emails or text messages;</p>\r\n<p>12. Inappropriate advances on social networking sites;</p>\r\n<p>13. Accessing sexually explicit internet sites;</p>\r\n<p>14. Behaviour that may also be considered to be an offence under criminal law, such as physical&nbsp;assault, indecent exposure, sexual assault, stalking or obscene communications.</p>\r\n<p>Just because someone does not object to inappropriate behaviour in the workplace at the time, it does&nbsp;not mean that they are consenting to the behaviour.&nbsp;Sexual harassment occurs in the workplace when it happens at work, at work-related events, between&nbsp;people sharing the same workplace, or between colleagues outside of work.</p>\r\n<p>All staff and volunteers have the same rights and responsibilities in relation to sexual harassment.&nbsp;A single incident is enough to constitute sexual harassment &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t have to be repeated.&nbsp;All incidents of sexual harassment &ndash; no matter how large or small or who is involved &ndash; require employers&nbsp;and managers to respond quickly and appropriately.</p>\r\n<p>The Company recognises that comments and behaviour that do not offend one person can offend&nbsp;another. This policy requires all staff and volunteers to respect other people&rsquo;s limits.&nbsp;The Company will not tolerate or accept any form of sexual harassment, in the workplace or in any workrelated context such as conferences, work functions and business trips. All staff members are responsible&nbsp;for their own behaviour, and under the law may be held personally liable if they engage in sexual&nbsp;harassment. The Company may also be vicariously liable for staff members found to have engaged in any&nbsp;form of sexual harassment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1.8. VICTIMISATION</p>\r\n<p>Victimisation is subjecting or threatening to subject someone to a detriment because they have asserted&nbsp;their rights under equal opportunity law, made a complaint, helped someone else make a complaint, or&nbsp;refused to do something because it would be discrimination, sexual harassment or victimisation.&nbsp;Victimisation is against the law.&nbsp;It is also victimisation to threaten someone (such as a witness) who may be involved in investigating an&nbsp;equal opportunity concern or complaint.</p>\r\n<p>Victimisation is a very serious breach of this policy and is likely (depending on the severity and&nbsp;circumstances) to result in formal discipline against the perpetrator.&nbsp;The Company has a zero-tolerance approach to victimisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1.9. VILIFICATION</p>\r\n<p>Vilification is where a person commits a public act which is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or&nbsp;intimidate another person because of their race, sex, religion, sexuality or sexual identity. Hatred or&nbsp;vilification due to an attribute protected under equal opportunity laws is unlawful.&nbsp;The Company will not tolerate or accept any form of hatred or vilification due to a protected attribute of&nbsp;another person.</p>\r\n<p>Any conduct that can possibly be observed by the public or any sort of communication either verbal or in&nbsp;writing to the public can be considered a public act. Workplaces can be public places.&nbsp;The Company may be vicariously liable for staff members found to have engaged in any form of unlawful&nbsp;hatred or vilification. Staff may also be sued personally or prosecuted criminally under Commonwealth or&nbsp;State criminal laws.&nbsp;Conduct that may constitute vilification can include verbal or written statements, or even be the&nbsp;reproduction or distribution of already published information. Examples include:</p>\r\n<p>1. Offensive material on the internet, including e-forums, blogs, social networking sites and video&nbsp;sharing sites;</p>\r\n<p>2. Offensive comments or images published in a publication such as a leaflet, flyer, internal message&nbsp;board or workplace intranet;</p>\r\n<p>3. Offensive speeches at public events, work functions or in the workplace;</p>\r\n<p>4. Abusive comments in any public place, such the workplace, or any other place attended in&nbsp;connection with employment; or</p>\r\n<p>5. In some instances, the reproduction or distribution of already published information around the&nbsp;workplace</p>\r\n<p>1.10. CONFIDENTIALITY</p>\r\n<p>It is unacceptable for staff at the Company to talk with other staff members, clients or suppliers about&nbsp;any complaint of discrimination or harassment without the Company&rsquo;s express permission.&nbsp;Breaching the confidentiality of a formal complaint investigation or inappropriately disclosing personal&nbsp;information obtained in a professional role (for example, as a manager) is a serious breach of this policy&nbsp;and may lead to formal discipline</p>\r\n<p>1.11. DECISIONS TO BE BASED ON MERIT</p>\r\n<p>All recruitment and job selection decisions at the Company will be based on merit &ndash; the skills and abilities&nbsp;of the candidate as measured against the inherent requirements of the position &ndash; regardless of personal&nbsp;characteristics.</p>\r\n<p>It is unacceptable and may be against the law to ask job candidates questions, or to in any other way seek&nbsp;information, about their personal characteristics, unless this can be shown to be directly relevant to a&nbsp;genuine requirement of the position.</p>\r\n<p>1.12. RESOLVING ISSUES</p>\r\n<p>The Company strongly encourages any staff member who believes they have been discriminated against,&nbsp;bullied, sexually harassed, vilified or victimised to take appropriate action by making a complaint in&nbsp;accordance with the Grievance Handling Policy.</p>\r\n<p>Any staff member who has witnessed any discrimination, bullying, sexual harassment, vilification or&nbsp;victimisation should report this to their manager or other responsible person in the Company, or can raise&nbsp;a complaint in accordance with the Grievance Handling Policy</p>\r\n<p>1.13. OTHER POLICIES</p>\r\n<p>Employees are encouraged to read this policy in conjunction with other relevant Company policies,&nbsp;including:</p>\r\n<p>1. Workplace Anti-Harassment and Anti-Bullying Policy;</p>\r\n<p>2. Code of Conduct;</p>\r\n<p>3. Grievance Handling Policy.</p>\r\n<p>2.

FLEXIBLE WORKING POLICY</p>\r\n<p>1.1.1. OVERVIEW</p>\r\n<p>FNQH Pathology&rsquo;s (&ldquo;the Company&rdquo;) Flexible Working Policy recognizes the importance of achieving a fair&nbsp;balance between work and other responsibilities (such as family responsibilities and care-giving). The&nbsp;Company recognises the benefits of implementing flexible working arrangements such as improved&nbsp;productivity, retention of skilled staff and improved employee satisfaction.</p>\r\n<p>1.2. OPERATION</p>\r\n<p>The Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) provides that certain employees (referred to in this policy as &ldquo;eligible&nbsp;employees&rdquo;) are entitled to make a written request for flexible working. Eligible employees may make a&nbsp;request to change their working arrangements, such as working part-time, compressed hours, flexible&nbsp;hours, job sharing, working from home, split-shifts and work re-design. The Company will consider such&nbsp;requests and provide a written response.</p>\r\n<p>This policy exists to assist the Company and its employees with the handling of such flexible working&nbsp;requests in accordance with the law. To the extent that there are inconsistencies between this policy and&nbsp;the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth), the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) will prevail.</p>\r\n<p>Where an employee who is not an &ldquo;eligible employee&rdquo; within the meaning of the Fair Work Act 2009&nbsp;(Cth) makes a request for flexible working, the Company will consider such a request at its own discretion,&nbsp;but the terms of this policy will not apply to that request.&nbsp;In so far as this policy imposes any obligations on the Company (i.e. additional to those set out under&nbsp;legislation), those obligations are not contractual and do not give rise to any contractual rights. To the&nbsp;extent that this policy describes benefits and entitlements for employees (ie those additional to those set&nbsp;out under legislation), they are discretionary in nature and are also not intended to be contractual. The&nbsp;terms and conditions of employment that are intended to be contractual are set out in an employee&rsquo;s&nbsp;written employment contract.</p>\r\n<p>The Company may unilaterally introduce, vary, remove or replace this policy at any time.</p>\r\n<p>1.3. ELIGIBILITY</p>\r\n<p>The Company will consider an eligible employee&rsquo;s request for flexible working and respond in writing to&nbsp;inform the employee whether their request is granted, partially granted or refused.&nbsp;Employees must satisfy the following before making a request for flexible working under the Fair Work&nbsp;Act 2009 (Cth):</p>\r\n<p>- Full-time and part-time employees: Must have been continuously employed by the Company for&nbsp;at least 12 months before making their request;</p>\r\n<p>- Casual employees: Must have been employed by the Company on a regular and systematic basis&nbsp;for at least 12 months before making their request AND must have a reasonable expectation of&nbsp;continuing employment with the Company on a regular and systematic basis moving forward.</p>\r\n<p>- In addition to the minimum service requirements set out above, to be an &ldquo;eligible employee&rdquo;&nbsp;under this policy, the employee must satisfy at least one of the following circumstances, and the&nbsp;request for flexible working must be because of those circumstances:</p>\r\n<p>- The employee is the parent, or has responsibility for the care, of a child who is of school&nbsp;age or younger (i.e. the age at which the child is required by the applicable State or&nbsp;Territory law to start attending school); or</p>\r\n<p>- The employee is a carer within the meaning of the Carer Recognition Act 2010;</p>\r\n<p>- The employee has a disability;</p>\r\n<p>- The employee is 55 years of age or older;</p>\r\n<p>- The employee is experiencing family or domestic violence; or</p>\r\n<p>- The employee provides care or support to a member of the employee&rsquo;s immediate&nbsp;family, or a member of the employee&rsquo;s household, who requires care or support because&nbsp;of family or domestic violence.</p>\r\n<p>1.4. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS</p>\r\n<p>An employee who believes they are eligible to make a request for flexible working and considers that a&nbsp;change to their working arrangements would have a positive impact upon their ability to balance their&nbsp;work and other responsibilities should set out their request in writing to their manager. In order for the&nbsp;Company to properly consider the employee&rsquo;s request, it will be helpful if as much detail as possible is&nbsp;included in the employee&rsquo;s request. For example, the employee&rsquo;s request should include the following:</p>\r\n<p>The type of flexible working arrangement that is requested, or different options of flexible working;</p>\r\n<p>- How a new working arrangement would benefit the employee in their day-to-day life;</p>\r\n<p>- A proposed start date and if relevant, an end date;</p>\r\n<p>- Suggestions as to how the employee&rsquo;s proposed flexible working arrangement could impact their&nbsp;fellow employees and how this could be overcome;</p>\r\n<p>- If it may be unclear to the Company why the employee is eligible to apply, then provide details as to&nbsp;why the employee believes they meet the eligibility requirements;</p>\r\n<p>- Any other relevant information.</p>\r\n<p>1.5. PROCEDURE</p>\r\n<p>Once the Company receives the employee&rsquo;s written request to change their working arrangements, it will&nbsp;consider the request, taking into account the employee&rsquo;s proposals and their impact upon the Company&rsquo;s&nbsp;ability to continue to meet its business objectives.&nbsp;If an employee is covered by a modern award, the Company will first discuss the request with the&nbsp;employee to try to reach an agreement about changes to the employee&rsquo;s working conditions, taking into&nbsp;consideration:</p>\r\n<p>- The needs of the employee;</p>\r\n<p>- Consequences for the employee if changes in working arrangements aren&rsquo;t made;</p>\r\n<p>- Any reasonable business grounds for refusing the employee&rsquo;s request.</p>\r\n<p>A written response will be provided to the employee within 21 days of the Company receiving the&nbsp;request. The response will set out whether the employee&rsquo;s request is granted, partially granted (for&nbsp;instance, it may be granted with conditions or for a fixed period of time) or refused.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1.6. AGREEMENT OR REFUSAL</p>\r\n<p>If the employee&rsquo;s request for flexible working is agreed in full, then the start date of the new&nbsp;arrangement will need to be agreed, a review date decided and the relevant change to the employee&rsquo;s&nbsp;terms and conditions will be documented in a Flexible Working Arrangement Record. It is possible also that the employee will be asked to execute a new employment contract to reflect the changes (though&nbsp;this will depend on the nature of the changes).</p>\r\n<p>If the employee&rsquo;s request for flexible working is partially agreed, further discussion will then take place&nbsp;between the employee and the Company to come to a mutually convenient arrangement.&nbsp;The Company can only refuse a request on &ldquo;reasonable business grounds&rdquo; (see below). If a request is&nbsp;refused the written response must include the reasons for the refusal.&nbsp;Modern awards contain specific information on what needs to be included in the written response if the&nbsp;request is refused or if a different change in working arrangements is agreed.&nbsp;The Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) lists the following as examples of reasonable business grounds for refusing a&nbsp;request (the list is not exhaustive)</p>\r\n<p>- That the new working arrangements requested by the employee would be too costly for the&nbsp;Company;</p>\r\n<p>- That there is no capacity to change the working arrangements of other employees to&nbsp;accommodate the new working arrangements requested by the employee;</p>\r\n<p>- That it would be impractical to change the working arrangements of other employees, or recruit&nbsp;new employees, to accommodate the new working arrangements requested by the employee;</p>\r\n<p>- That the new working arrangements requested by the employee would be likely to result in a&nbsp;significant loss in efficiency or productivity;</p>\r\n<p>- That the new working arrangements requested by the employee would be likely to have a&nbsp;significant negative impact on customer service.</p>\r\n<p>1.7. INTERACTION WITH STATE ENTITLEMENTS</p>\r\n<p>Any State or Territory laws applicable to the location in which the employee is employed that provide&nbsp;employee entitlements in relation to flexible working arrangements, such as carers provisions under antidiscrimination laws, continue to apply to the extent that they are more beneficial to employees.</p>\r\n<p>2. Managing Records kept on the basis of this document</p>\r\n<p>All records supporting this policy shall be kept in the FNQH Pathology document management system in&nbsp;the location, or system based, indicated in the procedure document. Any additional or deleted records&nbsp;shall be kept account of in the FNQH Pathology logging system such that any future inquiry will be able&nbsp;to clearly identify when the changes occurred, who made them, what these changes were and how the&nbsp;changes were approved.</p>\r\n<p>3.

OVERVIEW</p>\r\n<p>At FNQH Pathology (&ldquo;the Company&rdquo;) we aim to foster good relations amongst employees and between&nbsp;employees and management. We acknowledge that the enjoyment you experience in your job is&nbsp;reflected in how well you work and how well you relate to your colleagues and customers.We also acknowledge that problems can arise at work that may sometimes cause you to feel aggrieved.&nbsp;These problems can sometimes arise from the behaviour or decisions of management or other&nbsp;employees.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this policy is to allow you to have such problems, referred to as grievances, addressed</p>\r\n<p>internally in a timely and confidential manner.</p>\r\n<p>A grievance can be about anything done, or not done, by management or another employee or&nbsp;employees, which you feel affects you unfairly or unjustly. A grievance can also be about discrimination,&nbsp;harassment, bullying or any other employment related decision or behaviour that you think is unfair,&nbsp;unjust or upsetting.&nbsp;This Grievance Handling Policy outlines the procedures you should follow to try to resolve a grievance and&nbsp;also outlines the steps the Company will take to resolve your grievance if you make a formal complaint.</p>\r\n<p>In so far as this policy imposes any obligations on the Company, those obligations are not contractual and&nbsp;do not give rise to any contractual rights. To the extent that this policy describes benefits and&nbsp;entitlements for employees, they are discretionary in nature and are also not intended to be contractual.&nbsp;The terms and conditions of employment that are intended to be contractual are set out in an&nbsp;employee&rsquo;s written employment contract.&nbsp;The Company may unilaterally introduce, vary, remove or replace this policy at any time.</p>\r\n<p>1.2. WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS IF YOU HAVE A&nbsp;GRIEVANCE?</p>\r\n<p>In general there are three options to consider if you have a grievance, being:</p>\r\n<p>- Deal with the matter informally. A grievance can be dealt with informally by approaching the&nbsp;involved in your grievance, if you feel comfortable in doing so. You can tell them that their&nbsp;behaviour, decision, actions, etc. was unfair, offensive, discriminatory etc., and why you believe&nbsp;this to be so. The person may have been totally unaware of the affect of their behaviour or&nbsp;decision on you. By telling them you will give them a chance to redress the situation. This may not&nbsp;be appropriate in some cases, particularly if you do not feel comfortable speaking to the person.</p>\r\n<p>- Speak to your manager or other senior person. If you do not want to speak to the person directly,&nbsp;you can tell your manager about your grievance. They should be able to tell you what your&nbsp;options are. They may approach the person complained about and talk to them informally about&nbsp;your grievance. They may decide to take more formal action. Generally, they will seek your&nbsp;approval before doing anything &ndash; although sometimes they may decide that taking action will be&nbsp;necessary even if you do not wish them to do so (for example where failure to do so poses a&nbsp;health and safety risk). If your grievance is about your manager, you may wish to speak to&nbsp;another senior person. Alternatively, you may decide to make a formal complaint.</p>\r\n<p>- Make a formal complaint. If you do decide to make a formal complaint, this can be done by&nbsp;putting the complaint in writing and reporting it to your manager (or other senior person). The&nbsp;written complaint should contain a description of the incident(s), decision, behaviour in question,&nbsp;the time and date of the incident(s), the names of any witnesses, your signature and date of the&nbsp;complaint.</p>\r\n<p>1.2.1. IF YOU MAKE A FORMAL COMPLAINT HOW WILL YOUR GRIEVANCE&nbsp;BE HANDLED?</p>\r\n<p>Grievances will be handled in accordance with the following guidelines:</p>\r\n<p>- Grievances will be treated with the utmost confidentiality (except where the Company deems it is&nbsp;necessary to disclose the complaint for the purpose of dealing with it effectively; disclosure will&nbsp;be no wider than is strictly necessary). It is important that you also maintain confidentiality and&nbsp;do not discuss your complaint with others, unless the Company gives you permission to do so;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Any grievance will be taken seriously, handled impartially, and any steps taken will be in&nbsp;accordance with the principles of procedural fairness;</p>\r\n<p>- Employees who raise grievances are protected from victimisation;</p>\r\n<p>- Grievances will be dealt with promptly, taking into account all the circumstances; and</p>\r\n<p>- Generally, you may have a support person with you at any stage of the process.</p>\r\n<p>1.3. THE INVESTIGATION</p>\r\n<p>Where a grievance cannot be resolved informally, and the company deems an investigation is required,&nbsp;the matter will be investigated by such appropriate person as the Company deems appropriate. This may&nbsp;be an external investigation.&nbsp;How the investigation is to be conducted is at the complete discretion of the Company. The following are&nbsp;general guidelines only.&nbsp;During the investigation, you will generally be interviewed first, following which any witnesses, the person&nbsp;against whom the complaint is made, and any other relevant people will be independently interviewed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Both you and the person against whom the complaint is made will generally be allowed to have a support&nbsp;person present when the interview is being conducted.</p>\r\n<p>- If the complaint is substantiated, appropriate action will be taken (see below);</p>\r\n<p>- If the complaint is unsubstantiated, you will generally be given an explanation as to why that&nbsp;finding was made;</p>\r\n<p>- If the complaint is found to have been fabricated or vexatious, appropriate disciplinary action&nbsp;may be taken against you up to and including termination of employment.</p>\r\n<p>1.4. WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES?</p>\r\n<p>If the investigation reveals that your complaint is valid, a number of actions may be taken, depending on&nbsp;the nature of the complaint. The person against whom the complaint is made may be asked to give you a&nbsp;written apology, he/she may be given a written warning, counselling, transfer, demotion, or may be&nbsp;subjected to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p>\r\n<p>If the investigation is inconclusive, i.e. the complaint cannot be proved due to lack of evidence or the&nbsp;conduct is not sufficiently serious to justify disciplinary action, the Company may nevertheless take a&nbsp;number of actions. These may include training and/or monitoring of relevant staff.&nbsp;If the complaint is found to have been completely fabricated or raised vexatiously, appropriate action&nbsp;may be taken against you in accordance with the Disciplinary and Termination Policy including&nbsp;counselling, an official formal warning, transfer, demotion, or disciplinary action up to and including&nbsp;termination of employment, depending on the seriousness of the circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>1.5. WHAT IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE&nbsp;OUTCOME</p>\r\n<p>If you are not satisfied with the way in which your grievance was handled, you may have the option of&nbsp;raising your complaint with an outside agency, such as the Australian Human Rights Commission the Fair&nbsp;Work Ombudsman or the relevant State Anti-Discrimination Board and other bodies. You may also wish&nbsp;to consider making a claim in the Fair Work Commission or the court. In appropriate circumstances you&nbsp;may wish to seek advice from a union or lawyer.</p>\r\n<p>1.6.

SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY</p>\r\n<p>At FNQH Pathology (&ldquo;the Company&rdquo;) we understand that social media networks (such as Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram etc.) play an important part in today\'s society and that the majority of our&nbsp;employees may use social media in some personal capacity.&nbsp;It is important for all employees of the Company to be aware that much of the information exchanged&nbsp;within social media networks online or otherwise falls within the public domain, and the line drawn&nbsp;between what is considered to be personal and public is not always clear. It is also important to&nbsp;remember that information posted on social network sites can be easily traced and can generally be&nbsp;accessed at any time.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this policy is to outline minimum standards regarding social media use and participation&nbsp;for all employees during their employment with the Company.&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as this policy imposes any obligations on the Company, those obligations are not contractual and&nbsp;do not give rise to any contractual rights. To the extent that this policy describes benefits and&nbsp;entitlements for employees, they are discretionary in nature and are also not intended to be contractual.</p>\r\n<p>The terms and conditions of employment that are intended to be contractual are set out in an&nbsp;employee&rsquo;s written employment contract.&nbsp;The Company may unilaterally introduce, vary, remove or replace this policy at any time.&nbsp;The following rules should be followed by all employees of the Company in relation to social media&nbsp;networks. These rules apply whether employees are using social media either during or outside of work&nbsp;hours:</p>\r\n<p>- Employees should not post anything on social media networks that refers to their employment,&nbsp;the Company or any persons associated with the Company (eg other employees, directors,&nbsp;customers, clients, suppliers, etc) without the Company&rsquo;s express permission;</p>\r\n<p>- Employees should not identify themselves on social media networks as an employee of the&nbsp;Company. Employees should not, for example, post pictures of themselves in any work uniform;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- When participating in social media networks, employees of the Company should ensure that&nbsp;personal comments do not bring the Company or any of its directors or its employees into&nbsp;disrepute;</p>\r\n<p>- It is unacceptable to disparage the Company, or any persons associated with the Company (eg&nbsp;other employees, directors, customers, clients, suppliers, etc) in any way when participating in&nbsp;social media networks;</p>\r\n<p>- Employees of the Company should not participate in social media networks in such a way that&nbsp;negatively impacts upon their effectiveness and productivity at work;</p>\r\n<p>- Employees are not to access social media sites during working hours unless the use is directly related to the performance of duties required in the course of their employment;</p>\r\n<p>- When participating in social media networks, employees of the Company should not imply that&nbsp;any personal comments are endorsed in any way by the Company;</p>\r\n<p>- When participating in social media networks, employees must not disclose confidential&nbsp;information belonging to the Company or any other information the employee is required to&nbsp;keep confidential;</p>\r\n<p>- Employees are prohibited from posting pictures, images or other items of their work, place of&nbsp;work or whilst taken when performing their work duties without the Company&rsquo;s express&nbsp;permission;</p>\r\n<p>- Employees of the Company should not participate in social media networks in such a way that&nbsp;harasses, discriminates or treats unfairly or inappropriately any other employee, customer or&nbsp;client of the Company.</p>\r\n<p>Any breach of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</p>\r\n<p>1.2.

TELEPHONE, MOBILE &amp; INTERNET POLICY</p>\r\n<p>FNQH Pathology (\"the company\") provides this policy to set out guidance relating to telephone, mobile&nbsp;and internet use by employees.&nbsp;Inappropriate use of mobile, telephone and internet at work decreases productivity, causes security risks,&nbsp;distracts co-workers and colleagues, and can cause significant expense to a business.</p>\r\n<p>This policy is designed to set down minimum standards regarding mobile phone, telephone and internet&nbsp;use for all employees during their employment with the Company.&nbsp;In so far as this policy imposes any obligations on the Company, those obligations are not contractual and&nbsp;do not give rise to any contractual rights. To the extent that this policy describes benefits and&nbsp;entitlements for employees, they are discretionary in nature and are also not intended to be contractual.</p>\r\n<p>The terms and conditions of employment that are intended to be contractual are set out in an&nbsp;employee&rsquo;s written employment contract.&nbsp;The Company may unilaterally introduce, vary, remove or replace this policy at any time.</p>\r\n<p>1.2. TELEPHONE &amp; MOBILE PHONE USE</p>\r\n<p>The Company appreciates that staff may have a need to make and receive some personal telephone calls&nbsp;during work hours. However, unless in the case of an emergency, telephone and mobile phone use&nbsp;should never interfere with employees&rsquo; work duties, including but not limited to the service of customers.</p>\r\n<p>The following guidelines govern the use of telephones and mobile phones and the making and/or&nbsp;receiving of personal calls during work time:</p>\r\n<p>- Personal calls should never take precedence over the service of customers and clients. Unless&nbsp;there is an emergency, all personal phone calls should be restricted to legitimate work breaks (for&nbsp;example, your meal break) or before or after the commencement of your shift;</p>\r\n<p>- Any workplace telephones are provided for the conduct of the Company\'s business. Such&nbsp;telephones should not be used for personal calls except in the case of emergency, or where you&nbsp;have permission to make or receive personal calls by your manager. Any use of Company&nbsp;telephones for the conduct of any other business or for the financial gain of any other party is&nbsp;expressly prohibited;</p>\r\n<p>- All personal calls during the performance of your work duties, should be kept as short as possible&nbsp;in the interests of minimising disruption to work;&nbsp;Employees must not use Company telephones (including mobile phones) in any way that offends&nbsp;the law or as a device for delivery of offensive or objectionable communications. Offences of this&nbsp;nature may result in disciplinary action up to an including termination of employment;</p>\r\n<p>- Where you are provided with a Company mobile phone it is provided solely for the performance of your work duties unless the Company informs you otherwise. The Company will only pay for legitimate work calls and you may be required to pay for personal phone usage (unless you are&nbsp;informed otherwise).</p>\r\n<p>1.3. USE OF THE INTERNET AND EMAILS AT WORK</p>\r\n<p>The Company acknowledges that employees may need to access and use the internet to carry out their&nbsp;duties and to send and receive emails. In order to provide employees with clear expectations as to what is&nbsp;and what is not an appropriate use of the internet and email at work, the following guidelines have been&nbsp;developed.</p>\r\n<p>This policy applies to the use of the Company&rsquo;s internet and email services whilst employees are at work,&nbsp;and when employees access such services outside of work hours (for example when they take a Company&nbsp;laptop home or on a business trip or client visit).&nbsp;This policy also applies to the use of personal equipment (eg mobile phones and personal computers)&nbsp;that are used to access Company systems or emails.</p>\r\n<p>Please remember that your work emails are property of the Company, as are all programs and files used&nbsp;on the Company&rsquo;s internet and computer systems. You should therefore use all such systems and&nbsp;materials appropriately in accordance with your work duties and follow any directions given to you by the&nbsp;Company regarding their use.</p>\r\n<p>On request you must provide all password and login details used in connection with your work duties to&nbsp;the Company. You must also return all Company equipment and materials (eg laptops, USB drives,&nbsp;Company data saved in other locations, etc) on request and upon termination of your employment.&nbsp;As far as is reasonably possible, the Company will respect the privacy of individuals in the application and&nbsp;enforcement of this policy.</p>\r\n<p>- Only use the internet and email for legitimate business purposes related to your job;</p>\r\n<p>- Permission from your manager may be sought to use the Company internet in non-work time for&nbsp;study, research or other reasonable purposes;</p>\r\n<p>- Do not use the Company internet or email for personal use.

In addition, unlawful or illegal use of the Company&rsquo;s internet or email systems may&nbsp;constitute a civil or criminal offence for which you could be personally liable.</p>\r\n<p>1.4.

The practice information sheet provides patients with information on how to provide feedback, including how to make a complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Patients have a &lsquo;right to complain&rsquo;, and where possible, patients and others are encouraged to raise any concerns directly with the laboratory team, who are all trained to make sure patients of the business feel confident that any feedback or complaints will be handled appropriately. FNQH Pathology are committed to ensuring complaints will be responded to when the patients or other people such as carers, relatives, friends, or other consumers make them known to our team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Under national and QLD privacy laws, FNQH Pathology provides and adheres to a complaints process for privacy issues and those related to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).</p>\r\n<p>All members of the laboratory team are educated to be prepared to address complaints as they arise. Depending on the nature of the complaint and any advice received from our medical indemnity insurers where required, complaints are recorded and actioned with a copy placed in the patient&rsquo;s health record if related to patient care.</p>\r\n<p>All clinical, medical, and administration staff are aware of the professional and legal obligations regarding the mandatory reporting of unprofessional conduct.</p>\r\n<p>3.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Procedure</p>\r\n<p>Patients and others have opportunities to register their complaints either verbally, in writing (letter), or via our suggestion box. Patients or others are able to complain anonymously if desired. All members of FNQH Pathology are aware of our commitment to address complaints as they arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When receiving complaints, our practice keeps in mind the following in order to minimise further patient anxiety and hostility:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Handle all complaints seriously, no matter how trivial they may seem.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Verbal complaints made in person should be addressed in a private area of the business where possible.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Use tactful language when responding to complaints.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Do not blame others; patients may not have all the facts, or they may distort them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Address the patient&rsquo;s expectations regarding how they want the matter resolved.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Assure the patient that their complaint will be investigated and the matter not disregarded.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Offer the person an opportunity to complete a formal complaint form (they may accept or decline).</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Document all complaints and other relevant information and place this in the complaint folder so the person designated to manage complaints is informed of the complaint (even if the matter appears to have been resolved).</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Alert the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manager about disgruntled or hostile patients so they can diffuse the situation immediately - often patients are reluctant to make a complaint directly to a general practitioner.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Always inform the person designated to manage complaints if you become aware of any significant statements made by the patient or significant change in patient attitude.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>NQH Pathology has appointed to the Chief Technology Officer and Business Operations Manager with designated responsibility for seeking, collecting, analysing, investigating, resolving and managing all feedback and complaints.

Ensure the specimen is fully covered in sufficient formalin before leaving to fix overnight, a ratio of at least 10:1 formalin to specimen is recommended for adequate fixation.</p>\r\n<p>Dehydration</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>This stage replaces water with alcohol. Gradually increasing concentrations of alcohol are used so that the tissues are not damaged when the water and alcohol are mixed. Lower concentrations of alcohol tend to macerate the tissues when left for a considerable period of time. Absolute alcohol removes the last traces of water but can shrink and harden tissue, so the minimum required time should be used.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>A typical dehydration sequence for specimens not more than 4mm thick would be:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>70% ethanol&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 min</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>90% ethanol&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 min</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>100% ethanol&nbsp; &nbsp; 15 min</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>100% ethanol&nbsp; &nbsp; 15 min</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>100% ethanol&nbsp; &nbsp; 30 min</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>100% ethanol&nbsp; &nbsp; 45 mi</p>\r\n<p>Clearing</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>This removes the alcohol from the tissues before paraffin infiltration. As paraffin and alcohol are not miscible, an interposing antemedium agent is used. Xylene is used because it is quickly evaporated from the tissue during paraffin infiltration. Minimum times should be used as tissues can shrink and harden in xylene.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>A typical clearing sequence for specimens not more than 4mm thick would be:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>Xylene&nbsp; &nbsp;20 min</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>Xylene&nbsp; &nbsp;20 min&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>Xylene&nbsp; &nbsp;45 min</p>\r\n<p>Paraffin infiltration&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">- </span>This replaces xylene with molten paraffin to fill out cavities in the tissues to support structures contained within them, thus reproducing them in their natural state.

It has little affinity for tissue used alone but in combination with aluminium, iron, chromium, copper or tungsten salts it is a powerful nuclear stain. It has polychromatic properties, which may be brought out with proper differentiation. The active colouring agent, haematin is formed by the oxidation of haematoxylin. This process is known as &lsquo;ripening&rsquo; and takes several days, or weeks, unless it is hastened by the addition of an oxidising agent such as mercuric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, sodium perchlorate, or sodium iodate. These artificial oxidisers only start the process, so the solution can be used immediately, but this oxidisation process continues slowly over a period of time, during which the haematoxylin retains its staining properties. Once the oxidisation is complete the haematoxylin is no longer useful for staining. If the amount of oxidising agent is increased the process is more rapid, but the down side is that the life of the stain is decreased. The amount listed for any particular method should be strictly adhered to. Storage is another factor that may affect oxidisation. When stored in a dark, tightly sealed container the process is slower, but when the staining dish is exposed to light and air it is markedly increased, therefore in a staining set up, the solution should be changed at least once a week for consistent staining.</p>\r\n<p>Employing a haematoxylin solution, which contains an excess of aluminium salts, or acid, thus increasing the selectivity for nuclei accomplishes progressive staining. After staining with haematoxylin, the slides are washed well in water and the secondary stain applied.</p>\r\n<p>Regressive staining, the tissue is over stained in a relatively neutral solution of haematoxylin. The excess stain is removed with an acid alcohol solution, and then the sections are neutralised with an alkaline solution such as a weak ammonium water or lithium carbonate water. In a well-differentiated section, the cytoplasm should be colourless and the nuclear substances (chromatin) should be clearly visible, showing some metachromatic properties.</p>\r\n<p>Eosin</p>\r\n<p>Counterstain for haematoxylin is usually eosin. A counterstain is defined as a stain applied to render the effect of another stain more discernible. This is not the case in the H&amp;E technique, as the eosin plays a definite diagnostic role in the demonstration of inclusion bodies and cytoplasmic changes, thus it should be considered as a secondary stain.</p>\r\n<p>Common problems</p>\r\n<p>A common error encountered is the improper use of alcohols after the eosin has been applied. The primary purpose of the alcohols is dehydration, secondly the removal of excess eosin. If passed too quickly through the alcohols excess eosin will overshadow many diagnostic features, such as pigments and inclusion bodies. The correct differentiation of eosin must be observed.</p>\r\n<p>Groups of tiny dark grey or black granules are due to precipitation of Haematoxylin.&nbsp; These lie on top of the section and appear particularly common in parts that contain mucus.&nbsp; The only way of avoiding this precipitate is to filter the Haematoxylin staining solution about once a week. Skim off oxidised film on Haematoxylin each morning with hand towel, to stop background staining of the control slide.</p>\r\n<p>Dull red or brown staining of nuclei is most likely due to insufficient blueing after differentiation.&nbsp;Nuclei appear as blue rings with colourless centres when the Haematoxylin staining time has been too short.&nbsp;Uniformly weak staining of the nuclear membrane and chromatin is usually due to over differentiation.&nbsp;Sections in which the nuclei are blue and congested without proper chromatin details have not had sufficient differentiation, in very bad cases the cytoplasm is an unpleasant slatey blue colour.</p>\r\n<p>FIXATION<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>10% Neutral Buffered Formalin</p>\r\n<p>TECHNIQUE<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Cut paraffin sections at 3 microns</p>\r\n<p>SOLUTIONS:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>HARRIS HAEMATOXYLIN (ready to use stain)</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>EOSIN (ready to use stain)</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>SCOTT&rsquo;S BLUEING SOLUTION (ready to use stain)</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>70% ALCOHOL</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Ethanol<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>1400ml</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Distilled Water<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>600ml<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>1% ACID ALCOHOL</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Ethanol<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>1400ml</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Distilled Water<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>600ml</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Conc.

Iron is normally stored in the ferritin state and combined with B-globulin as ferritin, a compound containing about 23% ferric iron. Ferritin cannot be seen under the light microscope in routine paraffin sections, and does not usually give a Prussian blue reaction.</p>\r\n<p>In this respect it is distinguished from haemosiderin, in which the proportion of iron is considerably higher (about 36%) and the Prussian blue reaction is positive. Haemosiderin appears as brown, insoluble granules that give the Prussian blue reaction. It is found in any situation where excessive quantities of iron are being stored. This may occur as a local phenomenon or else is generalised.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever there is a haemorrhage, the iron from the broken down red cells is found in the nearby macrophages in the form of haemosiderin (and also ferritin). This is seen around organising haematomata, haemorrhagic infarcts, fractures, etc. A brownish discoloration around a brain cyst is therefore good evidence if it&rsquo;s origin from an infarct. The sclerosing haemangioma is often deeply pigmented and can be mistaken both clinically and pathologically for a malignant melanoma unless special stains are used. The epidermis overlying the lesion is frequently acanthotic and deeply pigmented with melanin; this is largely responsible for the pigmentation noted clinically. When the lesion is incised, the deep haemosiderosis is apparent.</p>\r\n<p>PRINCIPLE</p>\r\n<p>The first step in the procedure employs an acidified colloidal solution of ferric hydroxide. Acid mucosubstances and certain acid mucins are the principal substances in a tissue section that absorb the colloidal ferric ions. It is believed the initial linkage is an ionic bond of the ferric ion with the free carboxyl group of the protein. Iron bound to tissue substances is then demonstrated by the Prussian blue reaction. On treatment with potassium ferrocyanide, the ferric ion forms ferric ferrocyanide, or Prussian blue. Positive staining is therefore indicated by a blue colour.</p>\r\n<p>Non-specific staining is reduced by acidified colloidal solution and degree of polymerisation of the acid mucosubstances; however, the colour is usually a deeper shade than that produced by alcian methods. The colloidal iron method does not have the histochemical specificity of some of the alcian blue techniques.</p>\r\n<p>FIXATION.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>10% neutral Buffered Formalin</p>\r\n<p>TECHNIQUE.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Cut sections at 3 microns</p>\r\n<p>CONTROL.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Liver containing iron</p>\r\n<p>SOLUTIONS:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>COMMERCIAL KIT</p>\r\n<p>PROCEDURE</p>\r\n<p>1.

The PAS reaction is of value also in the study of fibrinoid degeneration, since the fibrin deposits in such areas are PAS positive. Furthermore, since the cell wall of fungi are composed of a mixture of cellulose and chitin and thus contain polysaccharides, all fungi stain bright red with PAS reaction.</p>\r\n<p>PRINCIPLE</p>\r\n<p>With PAS reaction, tissue is first oxidised by periodic acid. The oxidative process results in the formation of aldehyde groupings through carbon to carbon bond cleavage. Free hydroxyl groups should be present for oxidation to take place. Periodic acid will not oxidise newly formed aldehyde groups to further breakdown products, oxidation is complete when it reaches the aldehyde stage.</p>\r\n<p>The Schiff reagent detects the newly formed aldehyde groups. The first stage reaction involves the formation of a colourless, unstable dialdehyde addition compound that is then transformed to the coloured final product by the restoration of the quinoid chromophoric grouping.</p>\r\n<p>FIXATION<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>10% Neutral Buffered Formalin</p>\r\n<p>TECHNIQUE<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Cut paraffin sections at 4 microns</p>\r\n<p>CONTROL<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Ileum</p>\r\n<p>SOLUTIONS</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>1% PERIODIC ACID</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>59% Periodic Acid<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>10ml</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Distilled Water<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>490ml</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>SCHIFF&rsquo;S REAGENT&nbsp; (ready to use stain)</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>HAEMATOXYLIN</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>0.1% ACID ALCOHOL (as per H&amp;E stain)</p>\r\n<p>PROCEDURE</p>\r\n<p>1.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Bring sections to water</p>\r\n<p>2.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Periodic Acid<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>5min</p>\r\n<p>3.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Running Water<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>5min</p>\r\n<p>4.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Schiff&rsquo;s Reagent<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>15min</p>\r\n<p>5.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Running Water<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>5min</p>\r\n<p>6.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Haematoxylin<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>3min</p>\r\n<p>7.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Tap Water<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>1min</p>\r\n<p>8.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>0.1% Acid Alcohol<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>15sec</p>\r\n<p>9.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Tap Water<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>1min</p>\r\n<p>10.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Scott&rsquo;s Blue<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>1min</p>\r\n<p>11.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Tap Water<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>1min</p>\r\n<p>12.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Dehydrate and clear</p>\r\n<p>Results</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Fungi - Red</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Nuclei - Blue</p>\r\n<p>ZIEHL-NEELSON (ACID FAST BACILLI)&nbsp;MEDICAL REVIEW</p>\r\n<p>Acid-fast methods are most frequently used to demonstrate the presence of acid-fast bacteria in tissue sections. Acid-fast bacteria belong to the genus Mycobacterium, of which several species are pathogenic to man, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium lepton and various other species that cause mycobacteriosis. Certain fungal species also exhibit acid-fast characteristics as well as certain lipofuchsins and intranuclear inclusion bodies.</p>\r\n<p>PRINCIPLE</p>\r\n<p>Most acid-fast stains involve the application of a phenylmethane (i.e. Carbol Fuchsin) in a phenol solution. Phenol enhances the staining and appears to combine with the fuchsin dye within the acid-fast bacilli. It also functions to dissolve the fuchsin dye. Alcohol is usually added to the carbol fuchsin solution both to enhance the staining and to dissolve the dye. When the carbol fuchsin is applied, all cells, including the normally hard to stain acid-fast varieties, are coloured red.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The next step is the application of acid alcohol decolouriser. More uniform decolourisation is obtained with the use of an alcoholic, rather than an aqueous, solution. At the decolourisation stage, all the tissue elements, except the acid-fast ones, are rendered colourless. This is the classic acid-fast phenomenon. One concept states that acid-fastness is determined by selective permeability of the cell wall, and should the cell be mechanically disrupted, the acid-fast property will be lost. There also seems to be a correlation between the lipid content of the acid-fast bacteria and the ability to stain. Both are probable contributing factors.</p>\r\n<p>FIXATION.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>10% Neutral Buffered Formalin</p>\r\n<p>TECHNIQUE.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Cut sections at 4 microns</p>\r\n<p>CONTROL.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>AFB Positive Tissue / Leprosy</p>\r\n<p>SOLUTIONS.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>CARBOL&nbsp; FUCHSIN&nbsp; (ready to use stain)</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>ACID&nbsp; ALCOHOL</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Hydrochloric Acid<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>10ml</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>70%&nbsp; Alcohol<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>1000ml</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>0.5% METHYLENE BLUE (ready to use stain)</p>\r\n<p>PROCEDURE</p>\r\n<p>1.

Staff at all levels are encouraged to initiate, participate in and review quality projects and are provided with the appropriate tools and training.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>We seek feedback from our customers as a means of improving the quality of our service.</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>We participate in external and internal Quality Assurance Programs to continually monitor our performance.</p>\r\n<p>Quality Objectives</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>To monitor Turnaround Times for a limited set of specific procedures twice yearly and assessed based on National Clinical Indicators</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>To document all laboratory errors via the Quality System, in order to identify systematic approaches to reducing or eliminating errors</p>\r\n<p>Ethics and Behaviour&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Consent</p>\r\n<p>All procedures carried out on patients must be with their informed consent. For routine procedures written consent may not be required; the patient presenting for the collection procedure infers consent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Collection of Information</p>\r\n<p>Personal information is routinely collected from patients. This information includes that required to properly identify the individual and at times, medical history information or other details necessary to provide the service required. Unnecessary information should not be collected. The patient has a right to know the information collected, and the purpose for which it has been collected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Confidentiality</p>\r\n<p>All information concerning patients is confidential and must not be disclosed to anyone other than those directly responsible for the patient&rsquo;s care. Staff have a responsibility to ensure that access to records, both written and electronic, is secure. Computer terminals should be logged off when left unattended and password security observed. Any breach of confidentiality, either by commission or omission, will be regarded as serious.</p>\r\n<p>The regulations concerning confidentiality within FNQH Pathology extend to any information gained as a result of employment. Communication with the media concerning the activities of FNQH Pathology is expressly forbidden without the permission of the Managing Director. Any doubts about the provision of information should be referred in the first instance to the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manager.</p>\r\n<p>Performance of Tests</p>\r\n<p>Testing shall only be performed in an authorised manner, using approved methods and by personnel trained and authorised to perform the testing. Fabrication of results or use of unapproved methods is not acceptable.</p>\r\n<p>Freedom of Information</p>\r\n<p>The Freedom of Information Act guarantees access by members of the public to any information held by the Agency which they are entitled to see. The Agency is required to respond within 30 days of the request.</p>\r\n<p>If a FOI request is made of this department, it should be forwarded the same day to the Lead Pathologist.</p>\r\n<p>Operational Integrity</p>\r\n<p>No staff member is permitted to present for work in a condition which may impair their ability to effectively and safely carry out their duties (e.g., sickness, excessive tiredness, intoxication). All staff who present for work must be capable of carrying out their duties in a safe and professional manner. If they doubt their ability to carry out their assigned duties, they must advise the Senior Scientist or Laboratory Manager immediately.</p>\r\n<p>If a staff member forms the opinion that another staff member is impaired in their ability to carry out their work the Senior Scientist or Laboratory Manager is to be immediately notified. The Laboratory Management will treat any such information confidentially.</p>\r\n<p>Conflict of Interest</p>\r\n<p>Section 79 of the State Services Act details an employee&rsquo;s responsibility to disclose and seek permission to operate a business outside of the State Service. In addition, staff will not accept gifts beyond the agreed organisational limit or other disbursements from suppliers or customers that may cause improper attempts to influence staff.</p>\r\n<p>Undue Pressure</p>\r\n<p>(Examples: being pressured to release results on an assay when QC is out of limits, and before corrective action is initiated, being pressured to act outside your scope of competency).</p>\r\n<p>If at any time staff feel that they are being pressured in any way that would interfere with the quality of the test results, or with the quality of the process, the Lead Pathologist is to be immediately informed of the circumstances. It is essential that a log is recorded accurately detailing the nature of the pressure and any action taken to address the issue. A nonconformance is to be raised. The Lead Pathologist will use their professional judgement and will give the appropriate advice and will take any required action. The staff member involved may be offered counselling if required. If the Lead Pathologist is unable to resolve the situation, then the Managing Director will be advised.</p>\r\n<p>Ethical Treatment of Samples and Tissues</p>\r\n<p>Samples and tissues are to be treated with respect. Inappropriate or unnecessary comments about the appearance or condition of samples are not tolerated. Samples are to be handled and disposed of in an approved manner.</p>\r\n<p>Use of Samples for Other Purposes</p>\r\n<p>An excess of sample may be used for purposes other than that for which it was collected (e.g., to validate a new test procedure) but only if all identification is removed from the specimen.</p>\r\n<p>Identifiable samples may not be used for purposes other than that for which they were collected.</p>\r\n<p>Standards of Behaviour - Dress and Appearance</p>\r\n<p>Staff are required to dress in a neat, safe and tidy manner when on duty. No specific dress code is enforced but they should meet general community standards when dressing for work. Waterproof (e.g. leather, rubber) enclosed footwear (closed toe and heel) must be worn, (i.e., no sandals or thongs).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Jewellery should be kept to a minimum to present a professional approach and must not present an Occupational Health and Safety or infection control risk. Consider personal safety when deciding size and style of earrings, necklaces, bracelets (e.g., diameter of sleeper/hoop style).</p>\r\n<p>Long hair should be tied back or covered, and beards covered when undertaking aseptic or sterile procedures. Hair accessories must be functional.</p>\r\n<p>Standards of Behaviour - Courtesy</p>\r\n<p>Staff are expected to behave in a courteous manner to other staff, patients and visitors at all times, even under provocation. Discourtesy is regarded as a serious breach of discipline. Matters of&nbsp;dispute that cannot be resolved must be referred to the Laboratory Manager or to a senior staff member.</p>\r\n<p>Standards of Behaviour - Office &amp; Reception Area</p>\r\n<p>The Office and Specimen Reception Area are often the first contact with the Laboratory, either in person or by telephone. The staff in these areas must act in a responsible and professional manner at all times. Rudeness, abruptness and general unhelpfulness is not to be displayed at any time. In areas where staff are visible to customers or can be heard, personal matters are not to be discussed. In addition, matters concerning patients are to be carried out in such a fashion as not to breach confidentiality at any time. Discretion is needed when discussing test requirements and receiving specimens.</p>\r\n<p>Electronic Communication</p>\r\n<p>Email and Internet activity is governed by specific FNQH Pathology electronic communications policy.</p>\r\n<p>Courier</p>\r\n<p>The use of FNQH Pathology&rsquo;s car is restricted to staff engaged upon departmental business. Logbooks must be filled out completely after use.</p>\r\n<p>Staff undertaking courier work for the Laboratory are to maintain appropriate standards of presentation that follow acceptable community norms for persons in this position. They are to facilitate specimen collection and report delivery in such a manner that the needs of the customers are met. They are to obey all relevant State Statutes and Regulations concerning being in control of a motor vehicle. Any fines or other penalties are the total responsibility of the person in charge of the motor vehicle. Logbooks must be clearly and accurately filled out for each journey. Refer to the courier manual for further details.</p>\r\n<p>General Information</p>\r\n<p>Scope of Activities</p>\r\n<p>The function of FNQH Pathology is to provide a comprehensive Anatomic Pathology service for General Practitioners and Skin Cancer Clinics in the area. FNQH Pathology provides an appropriate service to the laboratory&rsquo;s client base in terms of range of tests, timeliness, cost effectiveness and access.</p>\r\n<p>The policies and procedures within FNQH Pathology are in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Federal and State Acts and NATA guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>Normal operation hours are 0800 hours to 1800 hours five days a week. Outside the above hours, an emergency call-back service operates. Pathologists and Senior Staff and are available for consultation when required.</p>\r\n<p>Pathologists and Senior Scientific Staff provide professional advice and assistance to referrers. Associated with this are regular clinico-pathology correlation meetings.</p>\r\n<p>Department cars are used to run a specimen collection service to FNQH Skin Cancer Clinics. A courier service is used for General Practitioners using the service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reports are delivered by automatic electronic upload to referrers through secure integration with Best Practice or other practice software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Research and Clinical Trials</p>\r\n<p>We are involved in providing services for clinical trials and research projects. The research / clinical trial must have appropriate agency ethics approval before any activity is agreed to by the Managing Director. We may elect to provide this service for activities within the scope of our accreditation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tertiary service role</p>\r\n<p>In situations where there is a problem with another laboratory&rsquo;s instrumentation, we are happy to add an occasional sample to our regular batch. Where the procedure is time consuming, resource intensive or exposes the laboratory to additional clinical risk, the Lead Pathologist must be consulted before agreeing to do these tests or procedures. See also section on request forms and contracts later in this manual.</p>\r\n<p>Laboratory&nbsp; Policies</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory is covered by policies and operational arrangements as decided by the FNQH Pathology&nbsp; Executive &ndash; refer to FNQH Pathology organisational chart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Service to the Client</p>\r\n<p>The clients of the Laboratory are GPs and Skin Cancer Specialists. These customers are the very reason we exist and as such demand the highest standards, both professionally and personally from all the staff associated with the laboratory.</p>\r\n<p>Client feedback is welcomed and provides a useful guide to areas in which our service could be improved.</p>\r\n<p>Clients are welcome to access and comment on our testing protocols at any time.</p>\r\n<p>Location</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory is located at 274 Mulgrave Rd, Westcourt QLD 4870 and consists of the following functional areas:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Specimen Reception</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Pathologist and Laboratory Manager Office</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Laboratory</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Storage Areas</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory is a modern, air-conditioned, well-lit facility for pathology testing.</p>\r\n<p>Members of the public must access the laboratory via the reception desk and must not enter the any part of the laboratory unless accompanied by a member of staff.</p>\r\n<p>Access to FNQH Pathology is via Westcourt Shopping Centre and FNQH Skin Cancer Clinic.</p>\r\n<p>Security</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory and offices are secured by locked doors, the public areas are outside the locked zone. Laboratory staff have access to all areas of the laboratory and offices during normal business hours.</p>\r\n<p>Any unauthorised visitor found in the laboratory should be challenged. The Laboratory Manager should be notified of suspicious behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After core hours, the Laboratory is locked and access is limited to staff with key access.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cleaning and Waste Disposal</p>\r\n<p>FNQH Pathology is serviced by a contracted cleaning service. However, staff are responsible for ensuring that work areas are kept clean and tidy throughout the day and that any spillage or excess rubbish is cleared to maintain a safe working environment.</p>\r\n<p>All areas are to be kept free of rubbish or excess items. In particular emergency exits, corridors and walk areas within FNQH Pathology must be kept clear at all times.</p>\r\n<p>Non-infective waste is discarded in the DFO shopping centre compactor, then is taken to the City tip. Infected material and histology specimens will be removed by a biohazardous waste removal service and incinerated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Information Technology</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory information system is PathHub. We have a trained staff member on site for general maintenance and other systems tasks. The application is supported by a service contract with the company and they are responsible for providing comprehensive support and maintenance. FNQH Pathology IT services augment this support as required. Access to the computer system is password protected, and staff have access rights based on need and experience. A system of regular (daily) backup of data is in place and is performed by FNQH Pathology IT services. The laboratory also utilises PathHub as Quality Management Software. The Quality Manager is responsible for overseeing general maintenance, configuration and other system tasks and the application is supported by the parent company Ideagen.</p>\r\n<p>Appropriate records of test results are kept either on hard disc or as hard copy as per NPAAC and NATA Laboratory accreditation recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>Validation of Software Changes</p>\r\n<p>All changes to laboratory information systems or software must be validated prior to introduction. The validation should take account of any potential risk to the integrity of data, and especially of any risk or potential harm to the patient. The rigour of the investigation will depend somewhat on the assessment of risk; this risk assessment is to be documented and is to be carried out by a senior member of staff. The validation is to be clearly documented.</p>\r\n<p>Communications</p>\r\n<p>Clinico-Pathology Meetings</p>\r\n<p>These are held on a regular schedule. These meetings are to discuss relevant cases and to provide a forum for direct feedback on the performance of the laboratory to the Lead Pathologist. Other medical and senior staff attend as required.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Senior Staff Meeting</p>\r\n<p>The senior staff comprising the senior staff responsible for each section, Laboratory Manager, Office Manager, Quality Manager, Pathologists and other persons as necessary meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of relevance to FNQH Pathology. Minutes are kept of these meetings. Some matters (e.g., personnel matters) may be excluded from these minutes as the Director or Laboratory Manager sees fit. A quorum is four persons including the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manager. Decisions from this meeting are not binding on the Managing Director.</p>\r\n<p>Sectional Staff Meetings</p>\r\n<p>Each section holds regular meetings as required to disseminate information. These meetings occur at least quarterly, but generally more often than this. At this meeting, the Senior Staff will give an outline of any matters discussed at the Senior staff meetings and give staff at all levels the chance to raise matters either to be taken to the next meeting or the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manger for response. These meetings are also the focus for continuing education and review of quality activities. Short minutes are to be kept of these meetings to allow shift workers, persons on leave and those unable to attend to gain an outline of the contents.</p>\r\n<p>General Staff Meetings</p>\r\n<p>These are held as required, usually at about 6 monthly intervals, but more often if specific issues arise. Given the nature of shift work it is acknowledged that some staff will be unable to attend meetings. Presentations, continuing education and general discussion are some of the matters that may be raised.</p>\r\n<p>Memoranda</p>\r\n<p>Memoranda are issued from time to time where a written directive is required. These are distributed throughout the Laboratory or to individuals as necessary. Authority to issue Memoranda lies with the Lead Pathologist or the Laboratory Manager.</p>\r\n<p>General Communications</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory is committed to providing timely and open communication between all staff. In general, the lines of communication as reflected in the organisation chart should be maintained. This does not preclude direct approach to the Lead Pathologist or the Laboratory Manager if an individual or group so wish. However, many problems will be directed back to FNQH Pathology level for resolution in the first instance.</p>\r\n<p>Administration</p>\r\n<p>The Lead Pathologist is responsible for the Laboratory. The Laboratory Manager and Senior staff are individually responsible for a number of management functions that cross over internal departmental boundaries.</p>\r\n<p>Education, accreditation, safety, computerisation and special projects are managed on a day-to- day basis by staff assigned to that area. They in turn, rely on other staff to assist and advise them. A regular meeting of senior staff reviews and discusses management matters.</p>\r\n<p>All Staff are subject to State Acts governing their employment.</p>\r\n<p>Lines of responsibility</p>\r\n<p>Staff must determine to whom they are responsible during the shift that they are working. In particular, the responsibility for verification of results must be clearly understood. The sub- departmental head or assigned deputy is responsible for the allocation of duties.</p>\r\n<p>When working outside normal hours, on-call and shift staff are responsible for the range of work authorised to be done.</p>\r\n<p>Assignment of Staff</p>\r\n<p>Staff are assigned to internal departments according to their skills and training needs, and the needs of FNQH Pathology. Senior staff are usually assigned permanently to one section. Other scientific and technical staff may be expected to acquire and maintain skills that allow them to move between sections and perform the routine &ldquo;on-call&rdquo; procedures. Clerical and support staff may also move between sections as necessary.</p>\r\n<p>Technical management is the responsibility of the Senior Scientist. Technical management of Clerical Services is the direct responsibility of the Laboratory Manager. In the absence of the Supervising Scientist another nominated scientist will deputise in this role</p>\r\n<p>The Quality Officer has the responsibility for ensuring that all aspects of the Quality System are implemented and updated whenever necessary. In the absence of the Quality Officer the Laboratory Manager will fill this role. Whenever the term &ldquo;Manager&rdquo; is used it should be defined as referring to the incumbent or his or her nominee in the absence of the incumbent.</p>\r\n<p>All staff in the laboratory have a Statement of Duties which is available online and which is updated periodically to reflect any changes in their duties. Education, accreditation, safety, computerisation, and special projects are managed on a day-to- day basis by senior staff assigned to that area.</p>\r\n<p>Authorisation to Issue Reports or Advice</p>\r\n<p>Professional Staff may give advice on test choice, frequency, and interpretation within the limits of the individuals&rsquo; knowledge and experience, if in any doubt the query must be referred to a more senior scientist or pathologist. Provisional results should only be released by a pathologist.</p>\r\n<p>Visitors, University Students on Practicum, Work Experience Students</p>\r\n<p>These must be authorised by the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manager. When so authorised, generally they will be placed under the direction and responsibility of an appropriate Senior Scientist. They must be advised of our safety procedures and issues relating to confidentiality and appropriate behaviour. They must be under close, constant supervision. Vigilance must be given to any computer access. Identification must be worn at all times. An appropriate dress code must be maintained. Any problems must be reported immediately to the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory manager.</p>\r\n<p>Deputising Arrangements - Periods of Leave&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lead Pathologist</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of the Lead Pathologist, the Laboratory Manager assumes overall responsibility for the Laboratory. For day-to-day clinical decision-making, the Staff Pathologists are employed.</p>\r\n<p>Laboratory Manager</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of the Laboratory Manager, one of the Senior Staff will be selected by the Lead Pathologist to act as Laboratory Manager. This person also assumes the role of Fire Warden.</p>\r\n<p>Senior Staff</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of Senior Staff, a nominated Scientist with sufficient experience and training will be given responsibility for the day-to-day operations.</p>\r\n<p>Quality Officer</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of the Quality Officer the Laboratory Manager or his / her delegate will fill this role.</p>\r\n<p>Education, Training, Performance Review</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory has a system of competency assessment to ensure that all staff develop and maintain appropriate skills in all aspects of their work. In addition, staff are expected to attend educational meetings and seminars to maintain and update knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>Training and Competency Assessment</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory maintains records to ensure the competence of all staff.</p>\r\n<p>New staff are given supervision while they work through a documented training program to ensure their level of skill is appropriate for the duties required of them. After this initial training, competency is continually evaluated by senior staff, and additional training provided as required. An annual competency evaluation is completed, this provides a formal opportunity to discuss any issues and offer any further training required.</p>\r\n<p>NOTE: Training and competency is the responsibility of each individual staff member. It is a staff member&rsquo;s professional duty to ensure that they are demonstrably trained and competent for all tasks performed.</p>\r\n<p>Performance Review</p>\r\n<p>New staff are given the opportunity to review their progress with their immediate superior at the end of three months, and at the end of six months when the probationary period ends. This is in addition to the continual process of direction and guidance offered.</p>\r\n<p>The annual competency assessment evaluation provides the opportunity for senior staff to review progress and development with the staff member. This is an opportunity to set goals for the next year, identify educational and training needs, establish an understanding of what is expected of the staff member and to provide an opportunity for the discussion of work-related problems. Any such training needs are to be documented on the annual competency assessment record.</p>\r\n<p>Continuing education and professional development</p>\r\n<p>All scientific and technical staff are expected to maintain a program of self-education.</p>\r\n<p>A regular program of education is established in the laboratory and all staff are to ensure that they attend and document their attendance. Compliance in relation to continuing education and professional development will be discussed at the annual competency assessment. All staff should also keep a personal record of any continuing education attendance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Periodic departmental meetings are held to assist in this process and time off to attend courses directly related to work is available where appropriate. In house training courses are available from time to time and staff are encouraged to attend these courses. A log of an individual\'s continuing education is to be maintained in the personnel file. It is the responsibility of each staff member to ensure that self-education is recorded.</p>\r\n<p>Some funds are available to assist staff to attend conferences and meetings and allocation is at the discretion of the Director and Laboratory Manager. The overriding consideration with regard to the selection of staff to attend conferences and seminars are the needs of FNQH Pathology.</p>\r\n<p>Safety</p>\r\n<p>The safety of staff, patients and the public are of paramount importance to the Laboratory. Staff must be aware of policies and procedures, and these must be followed at all times. Reporting of accidents, incidents and near misses is seen as an important quality assurance exercise to reduce the incidence and possibility of injury.</p>\r\n<p>Fire Safety Training, including evacuation drills are undertaken annually as part of the Laboratory Fire Safety Program and training in Manual Handling is undertaken Laboratory wide with all staff participation.</p>\r\n<p>Staff are encouraged to attend additional courses where appropriate, for example First Aid or Warden training.</p>\r\n<p>Incidents</p>\r\n<p>The primary means of notification for all health and safety incidents is via the Standard Operating Procedure and lodged with the Laboratory Manager as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<p>Samples and Requests</p>\r\n<p>General</p>\r\n<p>Samples are received from GPs and skin cancer clinics at Specimen Reception. Couriers are used to run a specimen collection service to off-site clinics. Taxis are used to augment this service if required. Internally Laboratory Staff are used for the delivery of samples from on-site FNQH Clinics.</p>\r\n<p>Request Forms</p>\r\n<p>A completed request form signed by the requesting Medical Officer must accompany each request. The sample must be clearly labelled and matched unequivocally with the request form. For Laboratory policy on unsigned requests and inadequately labelled samples, refer to the Laboratory Manual.</p>\r\n<p>Under specific circumstances forms signed by a person other than a Medical Officer (e.g. approved health care workers) may be acceptable. The Lead Pathologist, to whom any doubtful cases should be referred, will determine these circumstances. The Health Insurance Commission has determined that a treating medical practitioner may request a pathology service either orally or in writing but oral requests must be confirmed in writing within 14 days from the day when the oral request was made. A facsimile request is taken to have the same status as an original request form.</p>\r\n<p>For further information please refer to the Laboratory Manual.</p>\r\n<p>The Request as a Contract</p>\r\n<p>The receipt of a properly completed request form constitutes a contract between the requesting doctor and the laboratory. The laboratory is at all times obligated to do the utmost to provide the requested service, utilising approved methods and within a reasonable time frame. At times a request may be received which cannot be fulfilled due to reasons, for example, of incorrect sample or unavailability of the test. In these circumstances the requesting doctor is to be notified of the inability to fulfil the contract by phone and/or by written report.</p>\r\n<p>Where a pattern of non-fulfilment of contract occurs, senior staff are to be involved in review of these. This is to enable discussion with the requesting doctors and resolution of any problems.</p>\r\n<p>Transport of Specimens</p>\r\n<p>Couriers are used to run a specimen collection service to off-site clinics. Taxis are used to augment this service if required. Internally Laboratory Staff are used for the delivery of samples from on-site FNQH Clinics.</p>\r\n<p>Transport of Referred Tests</p>\r\n<p>The method of transport for referred tests will depend on the sample, the availability of suitable carriers and wishes of the Laboratory to whom the work is referred.</p>\r\n<p>All specimens that are transported by carriers are to be packed in accordance with IATA regulations and by persons specifically trained to do so.</p>\r\n<p>Specimen Receipt, Storage and Disposal</p>\r\n<p>Each sample is given a unique identifying number on receipt in the laboratory and all relevant information about the sample is recorded in the PathHub computer system (refer to the Laboratory Manual).</p>\r\n<p>All samples are stored in the laboratory in appropriate environmental conditions, which are regularly monitored and recorded.</p>\r\n<p>Specimens are stored for an appropriate time, using the current NPAAC guidelines as a minimum requirement. Samples are then disposed of in an appropriate manner as described in the Laboratory Manual.</p>\r\n<p>Reporting of Results</p>\r\n<p>Reports are sent to the requesting doctor and if required, copy doctor(s). Any other doctor requesting a copy of that report can obtain a copy. The onus is on that doctor to have a legitimate requirement for that result, if in doubt refer to the Lead Pathologist.</p>\r\n<p>Urgent Results</p>\r\n<p>These tests will be given priority and results phoned, faxed or printed to the location specified on the request form. Care must be taken to protect patient confidentiality when phoning urgent results. The procedure for phoning results, as detailed below, should be followed.</p>\r\n<p>Critical Results</p>\r\n<p>Any test result considered urgently required for the immediate management of the patient is to be communicated by phone to the unit concerned or to the requesting doctor. These critical results include but are not limited to malignant melanoma and lymphoma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Phoning Results</p>\r\n<p>It is essential that all results issued from the laboratory are correct. Incorrect results or misinterpretation may significantly risk our patient&rsquo;s welfare and compromise staff who issue those results.</p>\r\n<p>In this light any request for results to be provided over the phone MUST, in the first instance, be queried stating our preference to provide a formal copy, either hard copy or electronic. Remind callers that all patient results originating from a request in Best Practice should be available on that platform. In cases where the requestor persists that call must be directed to the appropriate place.</p>\r\n<p>All incoming calls must be assessed and directed according to the type of request.</p>\r\n<p>Before asking any other questions clearly identify the caller and the relationship around the request. If you are unsure or dubious about the need for the caller to have the requested information immediately refer them to your supervisor.</p>\r\n<p>For further information refer to the &ldquo;Communication of Pathology Results SOP&rdquo;. Only appropriately trained staff are to provide results</p>\r\n<p>Results Given Directly to Patients</p>\r\n<p>Results are not given to patients without a specific instruction from the requesting doctor. Should a patient become insistent they are referred to the Lead Pathologist or Managing Director (see also &ldquo;freedom of information&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p>Withdrawal of Results/Result Revision</p>\r\n<p>In cases where a report has been authorised, but it becomes evident that the results are incorrect, the report must be revised immediately. The ISO15189 Standard requires revised reports to be clearly identified as a revision report and the revision report must include the date and time of the revision, the name of the person responsible for the revision and the original report entries must remain in the record after revisions are made, including the exact change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Immediately upon discovery of the error the revised results are to be phoned or communicated to the appropriate clinical area(s) to ensure they are made aware of any changes to the revised reports. Record the communication.</p>\r\n<p>To issue a revised report when a report has been already authorised and results have been released use the procedure in the Reporting Errors Procedure document.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reporting Results</p>\r\n<p>Reports are sent to the requesting doctor and to any other person or location as directed by the requesting doctor. Any other doctor requesting a copy of that report can obtain a copy. The onus is on that doctor to have a legitimate requirement for that result. All confidential paper reports are to be addressed to the requesting doctor in a sealed envelope marked &lsquo;confidential&rsquo;. Before any report is issued, the pathologist must check the results for accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>Reports are checked for the following:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Patient demographics</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Accuracy and completeness of results</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Tests performed are as requested</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Request form is signed (or re-sent for signing or awaiting signature)</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Report comments are appropriate</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Copy doctors are included</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Compliance with laboratory policy</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Results from other laboratories are annotated accordingly</p>\r\n<p>Turn Around Times</p>\r\n<p>Average TATs for most assays are provided for referrers. Where there is likely to be a significant deviation from these times (e.g. by reason of instrument maintenance or breakdown) notification should be provided to the key requesting doctors in those areas where rapid turnaround is normally required. If the delay is likely to be extensive and clinically relevant, the Lead Pathologist shall authorise the use of backup services.</p>\r\n<p>Subcontracting of tests and calibrations</p>\r\n<p>For tests that cannot be done at this Laboratory under our Terms of Registration or tests that are low in volume or specialised, a referral Laboratory is selected based on Quality (NATA accredited), previous reliable and timely service, and cost.</p>\r\n<p>The referral laboratory is acknowledged on all reports issued from this laboratory. A register of all referral laboratories used by us is kept in the referrals database.&nbsp;Overdue tests for our referral laboratories are monitored in PathHub.</p>\r\n<p>Referred Tests</p>\r\n<p>For all specimens that are referred to another Laboratory, records are maintained to allow verification of shipping and return of results. There is also an audit trail to verify that tests have been returned in a clinically relevant time frame. Where tests are not returned in a relevant time frame, then action is taken with the referral laboratory to review the arrangement, correct the problem or find another suitable laboratory.</p>\r\n<p>Details of specimen requirements for referred tests are kept in the relevant section of the online handbook. All staff packing samples for air transport must have current appropriate IATA certification.</p>\r\n<p>Document Control</p>\r\n<p>All documents, including this Quality Manual, technical procedures, policies, wall charts and forms are reviewed at least every 2 years by the appropriate manager and updated whenever necessary. All master documents are stored on PathHub and are reviewed by FNQH Pathology heads (or their delegate) with final approval by the Pathologist who oversees that section.</p>\r\n<p>Complaints, Non-conformances and Improvements</p>\r\n<p>Any member of staff who becomes aware of a situation which may require corrective action should notify their Technical Manager as soon as possible. Complaints from clients and suggestions for improvement must also be communicated as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<p>Complaints</p>\r\n<p>All complaints are documented and directed to the Director of Pathology or Laboratory Manager as soon as they are received. A CA/PA should be raised in PathHub. Follow up can then be recorded. If a Staff member becomes aware that their action or that of others may result in a complaint being made, they should advise the Director of Pathology or Laboratory Manager as soon as possible with all relevant details.</p>\r\n<p>Control of Nonconforming testing</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory maintains procedures for dealing with problems arising from any aspect of our testing which for any reason does not conform to the test procedures. All such nonconformances are documented by means of a CA/PA in PathHub, as is the action taken to correct it. The Senior Scientist responsible for the area has the responsibility for evaluating the problem and taking appropriate measures to fix the problem</p>\r\n<p>When any problems are shown to be of a recurrent of systematic nature, more formal corrective action involving the Quality Manager and Laboratory Manager may be necessary.</p>\r\n<p>Corrective Actions</p>\r\n<p>Corrective actions are necessary to correct nonconforming work practices or any departures from policy or procedure that have been identified. The procedure for a corrective action begins with investigation to determine the root cause of the problem, followed by implementation of appropriate corrective action and subsequent close monitoring to ensure that the corrective action has been effective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Preventative Action and Improvements</p>\r\n<p>Preventative action is a proactive process used to identify improvement opportunities, rather than a reaction to the identification of problems or complaints. Follow up procedures are similar to those used for complaints and nonconformances.</p>\r\n<p>Control of Records</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory has established procedures for control of technical and quality records as per the NPAAC guidelines. Records kept include:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>testing and QC reports</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>equipment calibrations</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>internal audits</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>management reviews</p>\r\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>complaints, corrective, preventative actions</p>\r\n<p>All records of testing are kept in the PathHub computer system and are accessible to all members of staff with appropriate levels of computer access. All of these records contain full details of tests and results, operator identity and observations or notes and are fully auditable.</p>\r\n<p>Internal Audits</p>\r\n<p>Internal audits are performed on a regular basis. The audit system is organised and maintained by the Quality Manager.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of audits is to monitor the performance of the Quality System and technical procedures, and to determine whether any nonconformance exists or whether improvements can be made and discussed during management meetings (maintain a strong focus on continuous improvement).</p>\r\n<p>Management Review</p>\r\n<p>A Management Review meeting will occur yearly to review policy and operational issues. The Lead Pathologist, Laboratory Manager and Quality Manager attend; other senior staff may occasionally be required to provide specific items.</p>\r\n<p>Items examined include Complaints, Corrective Actions, Improvement Opportunities; Internal and External Audits; Document Control; Client feedback (e.g. customer surveys); Suppliers and Referral Labs; Reports from Senior Staff (Incorporating internal and external Quality Control, TATs, changes to volume/type of work).</p>\r\n<p>Methods &amp; Method Validation</p>\r\n<p>Procedure manuals are kept for all tests performed in the laboratory. These manuals are part of the document control system and are regularly updated by the Quality Manager and the appropriate Section Manager. Whenever possible the laboratory uses only well documented, standardised methods for testing. Any necessary variations are validated by the appropriate Section Manager prior to use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory documents the performance and comparability of a new test method before it is used routinely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In-house in vitro devices</p>\r\n<p>In-house in vitro devices (IVD&rsquo;s) are considered therapeutic goods which are regulated under The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. IVD&rsquo;s are expected to be safe, have a high quality and meet expected standards. All manufacturers of IVD&rsquo;s must certify that their products are safe, perform well for the intended purpose and are manufactured to a high standard of quality.</p>\r\n<p>Equipment</p>\r\n<p>All equipment used for testing is permanently on site in the laboratory and is regularly maintained according to a predetermined schedule and procedure by laboratory staff, or by the manufacturer or their agent. All equipment is operated by trained staff following documented procedures. Each item is uniquely identified and logged in the Assets Module in PathHub to enable records of its history to be kept.</p>\r\n<p>Equipment maintenance records are kept in PathHub. These include calibration and operational checks. Pathology staff perform preventative maintenance on certain items of equipment. Several items of equipment are under Service Contract agreements. Calibration and maintenance procedures and schedules are kept for all relevant equipment.</p>\r\n<p>Where a piece of equipment is found to be inoperable it is tagged and removed from service until repairs are carried out. A nonconformance should be raised in PathHub against the Asset.</p>\r\n<p>Specimen Carry-Over</p>\r\n<p>For all equipment, consideration is to be given as to the potential to report incorrect results due to specimen carry-over. Where this is possible, means shall be put in place to prevent this occurring.</p>\r\n<p>Temporary equipment failure</p>\r\n<p>QML Pathology is a NATA accredited Laboratory and, in the event of equipment failure or for any other reason, will provide backup for this Laboratory. In the same manner, we will perform testing for other laboratories as requested.&nbsp;The need for such a service would not normally exist for more than a day or two at a time.</p>\r\n<p>Operator Traceability</p>\r\n<p>To ensure traceability of the person undertaking the tests, all actions are recorded in PathHub, and any work sheets are annotated with the initials of the person performing the test.</p>\r\n<p>Assuring the Quality of Test Results</p>\r\n<p>Internal and external quality assurance is a vital component in ensuring that the test results and methodologies are of a standard that will not compromise patient care. All quality control results are to be monitored by senior staff and directions for action to be taken are contained in the specific method manuals.</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory participates in the RCPA and other external Quality Control Programs to provide a comparison of our results with other pathology providers throughout the country.</p>\r\n<p>Use of expired Materials</p>\r\n<p>All reagents, calibrators and quality control material used must be used within the expiry date of the product. However, it is acknowledged that in exceptional circumstances (for example for reasons of supply or quality of a replacement product) that this may be unavoidable. The use of expired material must only occur after consultation with the Supervising Scientist and under their direction. The test results are only acceptable providing there are no significant shifts or trends in the quality control results. If the quality control results are not acceptable the assay must be suspended until suitable product is available and has been validated. The use of expired material must be reported to the Senior Scientist.</p>\r\n<p>External Quality Assurance Programs</p>\r\n<p>All external Quality Control Program results shall be submitted by the due date. External Quality Control Results shall be an agenda item at FNQH Pathology meetings. Actions taken to address unsatisfactory performance shall be discussed and noted in the minutes.</p>\r\n<p>All external Quality Control results are to be notified to the Lead Pathologist. Remedial actions taken on results with unsatisfactory performance shall be documented on the External Quality Assurance program cycle summary and shall be reviewed by the Lead Pathologist. Where necessary after consultation with the Senior Scientist in charge of the sub-section, the Lead Pathologist shall direct changes to be made in methodologies, procedures or instrumentation or if necessary direct the tests to be done at another laboratory until the problem can be resolved.</p>\r\n<p>The Laboratory is enrolled in the following External Quality assurance Programs.</p>\r\n<p>PROGRAM<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>EXAMINATIONS/TESTS</p>\r\n<p>RCPA Anatomical Pathology<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Dermatopathology, Technical</p>\r\n<p>Financial</p>\r\n<p>General Revenue</p>\r\n<p>Laboratory purchases are made through FNQH Pathology. The Laboratory Manager has authority to purchase all reagents and materials necessary for the day to day operation of the lab. Small items of equipment, (under $5,000) can be purchased in this way although it is wise to clear items such as furniture, refrigerators, and non-scientific equipment with the Managing Director. Computer equipment should be cleared through the CTO.</p>\r\n<p>Disposal of Equipment</p>\r\n<p>Do not dispose of any equipment without specific authorisation from the Managing Director via the Lead Pathologist or Laboratory Manager.</p>\r\n<p>Stores</p>\r\n<p>Storage of consumables, specimen containers etc. is limited to a small storage area in FNQH Pathology. Other storage exists within FNQH Skin Cancer Clinic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>NATA&nbsp; Accreditation</p>\r\n<p>Authorised Representative</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Fiona Makowski is the NATA Authorised Representative for FNQH Pathology.</p>\r\n<p>NATA Endorsement</p>\r\n<p>Reports that are issued on tests done under the Scope of Accreditation may carry the NATA endorsement.</p>\r\n<p>Scope of Accreditation</p>\r\n<p>For the current Scope of Accreditation refer to the NATA website. The Quality Manager holds a current copy of this document if required.</p>\r\n<p>APA/APL Status</p>\r\n<p>Application has to be made when required to the Federal agencies for APA and APL status together with the fees.

Improvement activities shall be directed at areas of highest priority based on risk assessments. Action plans for improvement are developed, documented and implemented, as appropriate. The effectiveness of the actions taken are determined through a focused review or audit of the area.</p>\r\n<p>Laboratory management ensures that the laboratory participates in continual improvement activities that encompass relevant areas and outcomes of patient care. When the continual improvement programme identifies opportunities for improvement, laboratory management addresses them regardless of where they occur.
